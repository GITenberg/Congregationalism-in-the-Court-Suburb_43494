<h2><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the commencement of my History,
I wish to convey some idea of what Kensington was at the close of
the last century, when the original Nonconformist Church in that
place was formed and established.</p>
<p>Kensington as a parish must be distinguished from Kensington
as a village or suburb.&nbsp; The boundaries of the parish are
still unaltered, yet what it contained ninety years ago was
different, indeed, from what it contains now.&nbsp; It is
startling to read in Lyson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Environs,&rdquo;
published in 1795, the following sentence:&mdash;&ldquo;The
parish of Kensington contains about 1,910 acres of land, about
half of which is pasture meadow, about 360 acres are arable land
for corn only, about 230 in market gardens, about 260 cultivated
sometimes for corn and sometimes for garden crops, and 100 acres
of nursery ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I often think, as I am reading history, what a contrast exists
between its background of natural scenery, and the prospect now
before our eyes on the spot to which the history refers.&nbsp; We
should not know Kensington if we could see it as it was when
Hornton Street Chapel was being built.&nbsp; Then all around was
rural.&nbsp; Notting <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>Hill and the whole way to Paddington&mdash;where was the
parish boundary to the north&mdash;exhibited fields bordered by
hedgerows.&nbsp; Holland Park, to the west, was a lordly demesne
such as you see now &ldquo;down in the shires,&rdquo; and the
boundary of the parish in that direction, at what used to be
called Compton Bridge, was marked by a turnpike gate not long ago
removed; beyond it lay a bit of country landscape before you
reached the junction of roads at Hammersmith Broadway.&nbsp; No
great change had then taken place since Addison&mdash;who lived
in Kensington&mdash;wrote to the Earl of Warwick, saying,
&ldquo;The business of this is to invite you to a concert of
music, which I have found out in a neighbouring wood.&nbsp; It
begins precisely at six in the evening, and consists of a
blackbird, a thrush, a robin redbreast, and a bullfinch.&nbsp;
There is a lark that, by way of overture, sings famously till she
is almost out of hearing.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The whole is
concluded by a nightingale.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such were the warblers
that broke the silence of Kensington woods when no screech of the
railway whistled in the wind, and no lumbering omnibuses
thundered along the highway.&nbsp; Indeed, I well remember the
nightingales in Holland Park, after the commencement of my
ministry at Hornton Street.&nbsp; Earl&rsquo;s Court, even then,
was separated from Holland Park gates by a country lane which
began at Pembroke Square.&nbsp; But fifty years before, now
ninety years ago, it was thereabouts all pleasant open country,
dotted with homesteads, paddocks, gardens; whilst at eventide
broad green meadows saw &ldquo;the lowing herd wind <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>slowly
o&rsquo;er the lea.&rdquo;&nbsp; Brompton, included within the
parish, extended to the borders of Chelsea, famous for cosy
retreats occupied by merchants and literary men.&nbsp; Turning
from south to east, there opened, under the shadow of the palace,
those gardens which had become famous and much admired in Queen
Anne&rsquo;s time; and after Hornton Street chapel was built, a
minute of the Board of Green Cloth recorded that an annual
pension of &pound;18 was to be paid to a widow, named Gray,
&ldquo;in consideration of the loss of her husband, who was
accidentally shot while the keepers were hunting foxes in
Kensington Gardens.&rdquo; <a name="citation9a"></a><a
href="#footnote9a" class="citation">[9a]</a></p>
<p>Lyson tells us that in 1795 there had been new buildings
erected, principally in and near the hamlet of Brompton.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The present number of houses,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is
about 1,240, of which about 1,150 are inhabited, the remainder
are for the most part unfinished.&rdquo; <a
name="citation9b"></a><a href="#footnote9b"
class="citation">[9b]</a></p>
<p>So much for the parish.&nbsp; Now look at the Court suburb; so
small in comparison with the parish, that it may be compared to a
shrivelled kernel in a nutshell.&nbsp; There, in the centre,
stood the old Parish Church, pronounced by Bishop Blomfield the
ugliest in the country; and in Church Street, higher up, the
Vicarage was encompassed by a goodly garden and small park, now
covered by rows of houses.&nbsp; Quaint-looking tenements
bordered Church Street a little way.&nbsp; <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Campden House
and grounds retained a palatial appearance.&nbsp; A row of brick
dwellings, taking us back to the days of the first Georges, still
line Holland Street, and were then in their prime.&nbsp; Hornton
Street looked out, in spring, upon blooming orchards.&nbsp; The
road between Kensington Palace Gate and Holland House was, as it
still is, the main thoroughfare; and I conclude that Phillimore
Place, called by the Prince Regent &ldquo;Dish-clout Row,&rdquo;
from its tasteless slabs in front, was then in pristine
pride.&nbsp; Kensington Square, though shorn of the glories it
possessed under the first two Georges&mdash;when it boasted of
forty coaches, and of lords and ladies occupying the buildings
round it&mdash;still presented much quiet respectability; and old
inhabitants, as they passed by the palace gates, could tell of
having heard from their fathers and mothers how one morning there
issued thence &ldquo;Horse Guards with their trumpets, and a
company of heralds with their tabards, to proclaim, after Queen
Anne&rsquo;s death, George, by the grace of God, of Great
Britain, France, and Ireland, King, Defender of the
Faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All round, the Court suburb was separated from neighbouring
hamlets by a belt of orchards, gardens, and nursery grounds; and
the road between Kensington Gardens and Knightsbridge remained
notorious for its loneliness and perils.&nbsp; Opposite Hyde Park
were a few aristocratic mansions, with spacious lawns,
shrubberies, and gardens bounded by lofty walls; but the road was
often in very bad repair.&nbsp; In the middle <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>of the
century, Lord Hervey told his mother it was impassable, and that
in Kensington he lived &ldquo;in the same solitude as he should
do if cast on a rock in the middle of the ocean.&rdquo; <a
name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11"
class="citation">[11]</a>&nbsp; Matters might have mended
somewhat at the time the chapel was built, but a good old
pew-opener, Mr. Mundy, told me how he remembered that people at
Knightsbridge, bound for Kensington after dark, would wait till
they made a number large enough to defend themselves against the
footpads who infested the thoroughfare.&nbsp; The old half-way
house and the turnpike gate, symbolical of ancient days, lingered
so late as the middle of my own ministry.</p>
<p>Along that road, and through Kensington suburbs, George III.
used to drive down to Windsor in a lumbering coach with outriders
and an escort.&nbsp; There sat on the box, in grand livery,
&ldquo;a body coachman,&rdquo; as he was called.&nbsp; His name
was Saunders.&nbsp; To speak of that good man may seem to be
travelling out of my record, but it will be seen that he played
an important part in Kensington Church history.&nbsp; He was a
favourite with His Majesty, and used to put tracts in the pocket
of the coach for his master to read on the way to the Royal
Borough.&nbsp; The latter liked them so well, that he encouraged
the servant to keep the pocket furnished with such publications;
and we can fancy the Queen&rsquo;s grandfather, in his cocked hat
and neat wig, poring over the pages provided for his
entertainment and benefit.&nbsp; <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>The coachman was a Nonconformist, and
when he was staying at Windsor gathered a few people together in
a house which bore the unattractive name of &ldquo;Hole in the
Wall,&rdquo; where they held a religious service, and formed the
nucleus of the Independent Church of which I was pastor for
eleven years, part of it as colleague with the venerable
Alexander Redford.&nbsp; It is a curious coincidence that this
worthy coachman may be accounted founder of the two Churches in
which I have laboured the whole of my pastoral life.</p>
<p>He lived part of his time at Kensington, and wished to see a
Nonconformist congregation there.&nbsp; He met with a few people
in &ldquo;a very humble dwelling,&rdquo; <a
name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a> for religious worship, and out of that
grew the Dissenting Church in Hornton Street.</p>
<p>Kensington Parish Church, between 1762 and 1770, was favoured
with the ministry of the celebrated Dr. Jortin, an author and
preacher of extraordinary reputation; and he was succeeded by Dr.
Waller, of whom I know nothing except that he was killed by the
fall of a chimney during a great hurricane in November,
1795.&nbsp; Then came the Rev. Richard Omerod.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
was no man, perhaps, who more eminently possessed the faculty of
conciliating all ranks and orders in a large and populous parish
than Mr. Omerod.&nbsp; Nor was this effected by courtly demeanour
or by flattering profession, but by that honest and amiable
simplicity <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>of life and heart, which both dignify and recommend the
Christian minister.&nbsp; To a native purity of mind and
unaffected sanctity of life, he added a calm, gentle, and
unobtrusive manner, which never failed at once to disarm
hostility and to command respect.&nbsp; In his discharge of the
complicated duties of a parish priest he was eminent and
exemplary.&nbsp; By the higher orders he was respected and
admired, and by the lower orders he was venerated and loved; and
possessing alike the confidence of both, he was the channel of
communicating the bounty of the one to relieve the necessities of
the other.&rdquo; <a name="citation13a"></a><a
href="#footnote13a" class="citation">[13a]</a>&nbsp; He was vicar
from 1795 to 1816.</p>
<p>Dr. Waller was incumbent when the body coachman held his
meetings at Kensington, and Mr. Omerod succeeded Dr. Waller soon
after Hornton Street Chapel was built.</p>
<p>I wish we knew more of that coachman, who deserves to be held
in honour by the congregation of the present day; since it
appears that he not only brought together a nucleus for the
Church, but contributed out of his limited means ten pounds for
the erection of a chapel. <a name="citation13b"></a><a
href="#footnote13b" class="citation">[13b]</a></p>
<p>The earliest document preserved relative to the building I may
here insert, as it indicates the different elements of
Nonconformity blended in the enterprise.&nbsp; Some of the
originators, most it would seem, were <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Presbyterians, but united with them
were Independents and others.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>To the friends of Religious Liberty</i>,
<i>Sincere Christianity</i>, <i>and of Benevolent
dispositions</i>, <i>etc.</i>:</p>
<p>We, the undersigned,&mdash;of whom some have been educated in
the principles of the Established Church of Scotland, and others
in that class of Dissenters in England whose principles,
opinions, and faith is the most generally consonant to, and
founded on, the Word of God as revealed in the Scriptures of the
Old and New Testament, and on the essential doctrines of
Christianity as professed by both the National Churches of
England and Scotland;&mdash;being, therefore, Dissenters from the
established mode of worship in this country, and being situated
at a great distance from any place of worship agreeable to the
dictates of our consciences, we, from pure motives of religion
and piety alone, for conveniency to ourselves and families, and
to others who may be like-minded with us in matters of religion,
do propose, under the favour and blessing of a Divine Providence,
to erect and build a (temple) for the worship of Almighty God in
the parish of Kensington and county of Middlesex.</p>
<p>We profess our religious opinions to be, according to the
rites, form of worship, as well as of the doctrines and
discipline agreed upon in the Confession of Faith, by the
Assembly of Divines at Westminster (so far as the circumstances
of our situation will admit of); we wish to follow their
soundness of faith, purity, and simplicity of worship, as far as
we judge them founded on the Word of God, agreeable to the
standard of faith contained in the Holy Scriptures, the alone
unerring guide of faith and manners.</p>
<p>We therefore invite the serious Christian, the friends and
lovers of Gospel truth, to join with us in this good undertaking
to promote the glory of God, the interests of true religion, and
the eternal happiness of ourselves and fellow-Christians; having
nothing in view but to forward the attainment of these great
objects, we leave the briers, and thorny fields of disputation,
and false philosophy, of factions, politics, and jarring
interests of ambitious men, &ldquo;that we may lead quiet and
peaceable lives in all godliness and honesty,&rdquo; as
commanded.&nbsp; 1 Timothy ii. 1, 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Connected with this document is another, shorter <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>and more
general, stating &ldquo;that a suitable piece of ground, on a
long lease,&rdquo; had been secured, on which was to be erected a
building, &ldquo;estimated at upwards of &pound;900,&rdquo; which
had been already begun, and was then &ldquo;carrying
on.&rdquo;&nbsp; The object of this paper was to secure
contributions.&nbsp; The builders&rsquo; estimate amounted to
&pound;927 15<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>&nbsp; The structure was at once
duly registered, &ldquo;pursuant to the Act of Toleration in that
case made and provided.&rdquo;&nbsp; A recommendation of the case
is preserved, signed by several ministers, chiefly Presbyterians,
stating that friends at Kensington, for themselves and
neighbours&mdash;as there &ldquo;was no proper regular place of
worship for those who could not conform with the Established
Church&mdash;had determined to unite their efforts towards
supplying this defect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dimensions of the edifice were sixty feet by forty inside;
but the ground in length extended to one hundred and nine
feet.</p>
<h2><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>I.&nbsp; THE FIRST PASTORATE.<br />
<i>THE REV. JOHN LAKE</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">No</span> account is given of the chapel
opening; but in October, 1794, an invitation appears, in the name
of &ldquo;the trustees and subscribers,&rdquo; addressed to the
Rev. John Lake, M.A., <a name="citation17"></a><a
href="#footnote17" class="citation">[17]</a> requesting him to
take &ldquo;the pastoral charge of the congregation,&rdquo; to
which, in the following month, an answer was returned accepting
the charge, and expressing a hope that the people would receive
the Word preached with meekness and affection, with freedom from
prejudice, and with the simplicity of little children.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Carefully guard,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;against whatever
may engender strife and division.&nbsp; Endeavour to keep the
unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.&nbsp; Live in peace,
and may the God of love and peace be with <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Lake, it is believed, was a
Presbyterian clergyman, and on the 1st of March he preached two
discourses suitable to the occasion, which was to unite
&ldquo;several constant and serious hearers at the new
chapel&rdquo; in &ldquo;church communion,&rdquo; that they might
enjoy &ldquo;religious ordinances.&rdquo;&nbsp; The tone of the
whole letter is devout and beautiful, and gives a favourable
impression of the writer&rsquo;s character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Sunday, March 8th, a special meeting was held at the
chapel in the afternoon, of as many as were desirous of joining
as members and communicants at the Lord&rsquo;s Table, when Mr.
Lake attended and entered into religious conversation with those
present, to whom he also delivered a suitable exhortation.&nbsp;
The service was begun and concluded with prayer, singing,
etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;March 30th.&nbsp; The Rev. Mr. Lake, who had accepted
the pastoral office some months ago, removed with his family to
Kensington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Thursday, April 9th (notice having been given from
the pulpit the preceding Lord&rsquo;s Day), Mr. Lake was set
apart and admitted to the pastoral office in this Church, in the
following manner: The Rev. Mr. Moore began with prayer and
reading some suitable portions of Scripture; then singing; Dr.
Hunter prayed; singing; the Rev. Mr. Smith preached a suitable
and excellent sermon from Ezekiel iii. 17&ndash;21; then singing,
after which Mr. Rutledge concluded with prayer and
benediction.&nbsp; Several other ministers, besides those who
engaged, were present.&nbsp; The reverend ministers and <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>some of the
principal heads of families afterwards dined together.&nbsp; The
service at chapel was conducted to the general satisfaction of
all present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Friday, April 10th, in the evening, a sermon,
preparatory to the administration of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, was
preached by the Rev. Mr. Love, from Exodus iii. 5.&nbsp; A
meeting was afterwards held to consult about the choice of
elders, when, after some deliberation, it was thought proper to
postpone the choice to a future opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Sunday, April 12th, the members enjoyed the long
wished for opportunity of joining as a Christian Church at the
table of the Lord.&nbsp; The Lord&rsquo;s Supper was dispensed in
the chapel for the first time by the Rev. Mr. Lake, in the
following manner: After preaching a suitable discourse from 1
Corinthians xi. 26, and giving out a Psalm, he came from the
pulpit to the communion table, where a linen cloth and the
elements had been previously laid, the great pew, as well as
three or four of the adjoining pews, were filled with
communicants.&nbsp; After rehearsing the words of institution,
with some useful remarks, Mr. Lake prayed what has been called
the consecration prayer; then, with further address to the
communicants, he distributed the elements of bread and
wine.&nbsp; After which, during the singing of a hymn, he
returned to the pulpit, gave an exhortation to those who had
received, and concluded the whole with prayer, benediction, and a
collection, as is usual on such occasions.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>The
record of that first communion is very interesting.&nbsp; I have
seen the solemnization of the Holy Supper after different
methods: at Rome, before the high altar of St. Peter&rsquo;s,
amidst lights, flowers, and incense, with attendant cardinals,
and all the pomp and splendour of a Roman court, and have there
witnessed theatrical effects; in England, within the choir of a
Protestant cathedral, I have beheld a bishop and his clergy
administering the eucharist to kneeling worshippers, and have
recognised in the scene much picturesque beauty.&nbsp; But I must
say, that while reading the entry in the Kensington Church book,
illuminated by my own memories of its communion Sundays during
more than thirty years, I have before me a mode of
administration, not only different from those just indicated, but
in simplicity approaching, in my estimation, as near as possible
to the Passover feast in the upper room at Jerusalem.&nbsp; It
adds greatly to the interest of this unpretending record, to
recall to mind contemporary events.&nbsp; The Church was formed,
the minister was ordained, and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper was
administered just at the period of &ldquo;the Reign of
Terror&rdquo; in Paris and throughout France; and, I may add, a
different reign of terror in London and Great Britain.&nbsp; The
revolution storm had been breaking in wild fury over our
continental neighbours.&nbsp; Blood had been poured out like
water by a ferocious tribunal of madmen calling themselves
patriots.&nbsp; In two months, out of seven thousand political
prisoners, five hundred and twenty-seven had perished under the
guillotine.&nbsp; <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>Neither sex nor age, neither rank nor obscurity, neither
wealth nor indigence had shielded the most innocent from
vengeance.&nbsp; Exiles had swarmed over to England, and were
hiding their poverty and shame in the country village, the
English capital, and the Court suburb.&nbsp; Tales of change
after change had reached our shores, and filled thousands of
hearts with terror.&nbsp; English rulers of that day, terrified
by what they heard, may be really said to have lost their heads,
for they adopted such tyrannical measures for repressing sedition
and treason, that Charles James Fox said in reference to the
trials of Muir and Palmer in Scotland, that if the law enforced
there should be brought into England, it would be high time for
&ldquo;him and his friends to settle their affairs and retire to
some happier clime.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was just afterwards, and
whilst order on the one side and freedom on the other were in
jeopardy, that the humble fathers and founders of the Church at
Kensington met to choose a pastor and to celebrate the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper in their new fellowship.&nbsp;
&ldquo;God,&rdquo; says the forty-sixth Psalm, &ldquo;is our
refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.&nbsp;
Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and
though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; though
the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains
shake with the swelling thereof.&nbsp; <i>There is a river</i>,
<i>the streams whereof shall make glad the city of
God</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; As political storms roared around, the
Kensington company enjoyed that Divine consolation.</p>
<p>The names of the first communicants are preserved, <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>and in the
course of the year 1795 eight others were added.&nbsp; In 1796
nine more, in 1797 five, and in 1798 three.&nbsp; One of the
earliest members was a Mrs. Schmae whose husband was living when
I went to reside in Kensington.&nbsp; He was a pious old man,
full of faith, hope, and love; and when I visited him on his
death bed, he told me he had been many years member of Dr.
Steinkopf&rsquo;s Lutheran Church in the Savoy, and showed me a
German Bible he valued, which was given to me by the family after
his death.</p>
<p>The principal persons in the management of affairs at the
earliest period were Messrs. Forsyth, Broadwood, and Grey, all
Scotch Presbyterians.&nbsp; Mr. Broadwood was the famous
pianoforte maker.&nbsp; Mr. Grey was a proprietor of the
&ldquo;Brompton Park Nursery,&rdquo; spoken of as famous for
plants of all sorts, &ldquo;which supply most of the nobility and
gentry and gentlemen in England.&rdquo;&nbsp; John Evelyn visited
the nursery in 1694, with Mr. Waller, who &ldquo;was in
admiration at the store of plants, and how well the nursery was
cultivated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amongst early secular incidents connected with the chapel, was
an attempt made on the part of the parish to include the building
in the poor-rate assessment.&nbsp; This was in 1795.&nbsp; But
the trustees resisted the imposition; and on the case being
considered by the magistrates at Hicks Hall, they decided that
the place being supported by voluntary contributions, could not
be justly liable to the parish rate.&nbsp; Similar attempts were
made afterwards, with a similar result.</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>In 1798
the general monthly prayer meeting of the London Missionary
Society was held at Hornton Street, and the Rev. Dr. Haweis, it
is stated in the Church book, preached from the text,
&ldquo;Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the Lord.&rdquo;
<a name="citation23a"></a><a href="#footnote23a"
class="citation">[23a]</a>&nbsp; The entry deserves special
remark.&nbsp; Dr. Haweis was rector of Aldwinkle, in
Northamptonshire, and an intimate friend of the Countess of
Huntingdon.&nbsp; At that period a few Evangelical clergymen were
accustomed to preach in Nonconformist pulpits.&nbsp; The famous
John Berridge, rector of Everton, was of the number; and Fletcher
of Madeley frequently ministered the word of life to Methodist
congregations.&nbsp; Dr. Haweis delivered the first annual sermon
on behalf of the London Missionary Society in Spafields chapel;
and on previous occasions preached in places of worship belonging
to the Countess&rsquo;s connection.&nbsp; Whether it was owing to
that circumstance, I do not know, but as early as 1767 an
unpleasantness arose, which raised a question as to whether he
ought to retain his rectory; and the Rev. Martin Madan, of the
Lock Hospital&mdash;who, by the way, is buried at
Kensington&mdash;advised him to retain it, a piece of advice
which, we are told, subjected Mr. Madan &ldquo;to much
obloquy.&rdquo; <a name="citation23b"></a><a href="#footnote23b"
class="citation">[23b]</a>&nbsp; Preaching by clergymen in
dissenting chapels was deemed an irregularity, but some bishops
winked at it.&nbsp; Whether or not the practice be legal became a
topic of inquiry a few years ago, and counsel&rsquo;s opinion was
taken <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>on
the subject.&nbsp; My friend Dr. Stanley at that period expressed
a wish to occupy Kensington pulpit before I resigned the
pastorate, and an arrangement for the purpose was deferred in
consequence of a controversy on the general subject, which arose
at the time.&nbsp; Counsel&rsquo;s opinion proved unfavourable,
and the matter dropped.&nbsp; But I may mention that the Rev.
Samuel Minton, whilst still a Church of England incumbent,
preached for me one Sunday evening not long before counsel gave
the opinion to which reference has been made.</p>
<p>It is interesting to remember that Dr. Haweis was a warm
friend to the London Missionary Society, and that after having
offered four hundred pounds for sending the Gospel to Tahiti, he
said: &ldquo;For many years I have planned, prayed, and sought
for an opening for a mission among the heathen.&nbsp; My dear
Lady Huntingdon has concurred with me in attempting it.&rdquo; <a
name="citation24a"></a><a href="#footnote24a"
class="citation">[24a]</a>&nbsp; And again: &ldquo;My former
experience has convinced me that only by a general union of all
denominations could a broad basis be laid for a mission.&rdquo;
<a name="citation24b"></a><a href="#footnote24b"
class="citation">[24b]</a></p>
<p>That at so early a period of this history such a service
should be held was an augury for good.&nbsp; It showed that the
insignificant band of Christians worshipping in Hornton Street
cherished sympathies so large that they swept over the world, and
offered prayers that <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>the proclamation of the Gospel might
reach the ends of the earth.&nbsp; From the beginning the
Kensington Church associated itself with the history of
missionary trials and missionary success.&nbsp; Disaster at the
antipodes sent a thrill of pain, and success there created a
pulsation of joy amongst the obscure worshippers.&nbsp; Hearts
mourned over the capture of the <i>Duff</i>, and in after years
over the massacre of Tongataboo, the imprisonment and death of
Smith in Demerara, the murder of John Williams on the beach of
Eromanga, and the persecutions of early converts by the Queen of
Madagascar.&nbsp; From time to time the countenances of
worshippers have brightened on the arrival of good tidings from
the South Seas, from India, from China, from Caffreland, from the
West Indies.&nbsp; And I mention this because I believe that much
of the prosperity enjoyed by Kensington Congregationalists is
owing to their early and ever since continued co-operation in
missionary work.&nbsp; The keynote of their zeal and joy was
struck at that meeting which it is so gratifying to remember.</p>
<p>Mr. Lake&rsquo;s ministry at Kensington ceased in 1800 or
1801; and the only notice I have found of his subsequent history,
is that he at length quitted &ldquo;the Dissenting interest for a
curacy in the Established Church, where he sustained a
respectable and useful character to the day of his death.&rdquo;

27</span>II.&nbsp; THE SECOND PASTORATE.<br />
<i>THE REV. JOHN CLAYTON</i>.<br />
1801&ndash;1804.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The</span> congregation of Hornton
Street Chapel, Kensington, being deprived of the ministerial
labours of the Rev. John Lake, by his resignation, and remaining
destitute of a stated overseer in the Lord till the month of May,
1801, united in a call soliciting Mr. John Clayton, assistant to
the Rev. John Winter, of Newbury, Berks, to undertake the office
of their pastor.&rdquo; <a name="citation28"></a><a
href="#footnote28" class="citation">[28]</a>&nbsp; The invitation
was in the name of &ldquo;the trustees, church, and
subscribers,&rdquo; and received about one hundred
signatures.&nbsp; Mr. Clayton&rsquo;s reply is not given, but the
records state that he paid a visit and preached two Sabbaths in
the month of June; and on the second Sabbath of August, 1801, he
entered upon his stated labours.</p>
<p>Mr. Clayton was educated partly at Homerton College, partly at
Edinburgh University; and after the completion of his preparatory
studies he spent a short time at Newbury, as assistant to the
Rev. John Winter.&nbsp; <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>He had only just come of age when he
was invited to the Kensington pastorate.&nbsp; Having won for
himself a good report from the people of the Berkshire town, as
one who had done his work &ldquo;with the ability of a theologist
and the faithfulness of a minister of Christ,&rdquo; he was
praised by the senior pastor, who wrote to the young man&rsquo;s
father, saying, &ldquo;I see that he has now a call to depart
with a prospect of usefulness by preaching the Gospel in another
place.&nbsp; I therefore readily commend him to the Lord, and the
word of His grace, and shall rejoice to hear that all our hopes
are realized among the people of Kensington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Clayton was ordained in Hornton Street Chapel the
twenty-first of October, 1801.&nbsp; The Rev. W. Humphreys, of
Hammersmith, delivered the introductory discourse, and the charge
to the minister was given by his father, the Rev. John Clayton,
pastor of the Church assembling in the ancient Weigh House, not
far from the London Monument.&nbsp; This gentleman, dignified and
courtly, had come under the influence of Lady Huntingdon, and to
the time of his death remained attached to the doctrines dear to
the countess.&nbsp; His dissent was of a moderate type, and he
did not share in political views prevalent amongst his brethren;
in that respect his son resembled him.&nbsp; He cultivated
friendships with evangelical clergymen, especially Newton and
Cecil.&nbsp; When I was about to enter college I received from
him counsel and encouragement; and I remember well a discourse
which he preached at Norwich <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>fifty years ago, from the words,
&ldquo;Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where
we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they
do.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had visited the place forty years before, and
now came, he said, to see &ldquo;<i>how they did</i>,&rdquo; and
to make inquiries relative to their temporal as well as their
spiritual welfare.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you made your wills?&rdquo;
asked the venerable patriarch, with his thickly powdered
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The charge he delivered at Kensington to his son was a
most faithful and solemn exposition of ministerial duties,
enforced with amazing vigour and pungency of expression; indeed
at times there was a trenchant fearlessness of utterance almost
amounting to invective against timeserving, hesitating, cowardly
preachers who kept back the truth or proclaimed smooth things to
gratify graceless spirits.&rdquo; <a name="citation29"></a><a
href="#footnote29" class="citation">[29]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have not language [he said] of indignant
severity sufficiently strong to express the contemptible
cowardice, hypocrisy, and soul-murdering cruelty of those who
adopt an indefinite phraseology in order (such is the plenitude
of their prudence and moderation) that none may suspend their
devotion, but that a heterogeneous mass of nominal Calvinists and
real Arians and Socinians may be assembled (for united they
cannot be) in one society.&nbsp; Frost unites sticks and stones,
moss, leaves, and weeds; the sun separates them.&nbsp; Into the
secret of that frosty liberality may you, my son, never enter,
and to the assembly of its advocates never be thou united.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your testimony is to contain nothing but the
truth.&nbsp; Sermons should not consist in declamation, but be
calculated to convey solid instruction.&nbsp; You must teach, and
not trifle away time in exhibiting fine thoughts or playing upon
words.&nbsp; Let not your testimony be <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>encumbered with what is
foreign.&nbsp; Be like Paul, who could say, &lsquo;Therefore
seeing we have this ministry, as we have obtained mercy, we faint
not; but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not
walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully;
by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every
man&rsquo;s conscience in the sight of God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your testimony should be borne with zeal, in the heat
of which do not lay aside Christian meekness towards
opposers.&nbsp; At the same time, take care that you do not grow
lukewarm and indifferent under the specious pretext of
meekness.&nbsp; An unfaithful, accommodating pastor, perhaps,
applauds himself for carrying it fair with all sorts of people,
whereas this peaceable kind of preaching, in neither condemning
heretics and worldly-minded persons, nor being condemned by them,
is no other than a sign of his being himself in a state of
condemnation and death.&nbsp; That person betrays the truth who
ceases zealously to defend it, or to oppose its professed
adversaries, either from fear of giving occasion of offence, or
through a false love of peace.&nbsp; The shepherd should not only
feed the flocks, but also <i>drive away</i> the grievous
wolves.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Mr. Clayton had spent a year and a half in the seclusion
of what was then a rural hamlet, he met with an accident whilst
riding on horseback, an exercise to which he was addicted
throughout life.&nbsp; The accident suspended his work for a
while, and during that period his brother George helped to supply
his lack of service.&nbsp; There was considerable resemblance
between the two brothers.&nbsp; Each had a commanding appearance
and a sonorous voice.&nbsp; Both were accustomed to express
themselves in measured, ornate sentences, the style of which was
caught in a measure from their good father, who loved his sons,
and discriminated between them by saying &ldquo;John had the best
stock of goods, but George had the best shop window.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The attainments and <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>mental abilities of the elder certainly were superior to
those of the younger; yet perhaps the younger presented what he
had to say in a manner more ingenious and with even more
attractive diction than his brother John.&nbsp; They became, as
they grew older, types of a class at the time large and
influential, chiefly known by their intense and popular
evangelical ministrations, their exemplary discharge of pastoral
duties, their zealous support of catholic institutions for the
spread of the Gospel, their gentlemanly demeanour in society, and
their large intercourse with ministers and people of all
denominations.</p>
<p>Let me avail myself of the following reminiscences of Mr.
Clayton&rsquo;s preaching by my beloved friend, the Rev. J. C.
Harrison, who attended at the Poultry when Mr. Clayton was
minister there.&nbsp; They will, with some slight modification,
apply to his preaching at Kensington.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He was an admirable preacher.&nbsp; In the
course of the year you were sure to hear all the main doctrines
of the Christian faith clearly explained, or if not formally
expounded, thrown into a fuller light by some practical appeal of
which he made them the foundation.&nbsp; When he took up a book
of the New Testament, like the Acts of the Apostles, and founded
on it a series of discussions, he would draw out the spirit of
the narrative with great fidelity and effect, and would rise not
unfrequently into real eloquence.&nbsp; He was amongst his flock
hearing the tale of their sorrows or their joys, their mental
conflicts or their bodily sufferings, and becoming thereby
acquainted with all varieties of life and experience, all kinds
of spiritual disease, all phases of Christian character: seeking
meanwhile how to meet difficulties and soothe sorrow, and correct
morbid feelings, and turn tears of sadness into smiles of joy,
and thus he got together the materials for portraitures of
spiritual character drawn to the life, and <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>these he
wrought into the texture of his Sunday sermon.&nbsp; It is
difficult to imagine the help which such discourses afforded to
all classes of true Christian hearers.&nbsp; He mixed with all
sorts and conditions of men, lawyers, doctors, merchants,
tradesmen, mechanics; and as he was a felicitous and ready
converser, he not only threw out shrewd hints and sparkling
sayings for their advantage, but gained from them a vast amount
of information respecting their mode of life, their opinions and
practices, their weak points and strong points, their gains and
losses, their desperate anxieties and temptations, or their
exhilarating successes; and with these facts from life, in his
memory, he spoke in his sermons, &lsquo;not as one that beateth
the air,&rsquo; but as one who had been behind the scenes, and
knew whereof he affirmed.&nbsp; His strokes were not delivered at
random, but went straight to the mark.&nbsp; He could reprove,
exhort, advise, comfort, as if he were himself involved every day
in the whirl and wear of life.&nbsp; True his usual style of
speech was rather Johnsonian, intermingled with forms of
expression so entirely his own that you could only call them
Claytonian; but those who knew him well, found that he talked
very much as he preached, in rhetorically shaped sentences, with
a singularly felicitous peculiarity of phrase coined in his own
mind, and occasionally with a good-humoured subsidence into some
pointed colloquialism which told all the more forcibly from its
contrast with his ordinary mode.&nbsp; They felt, therefore, that
what he said was thoroughly genuine, the utterance of a true man
and not at all of a quack, or as he would have said, of an
empiric.&nbsp; But whether experimental or practical, his sermons
were richly and heartily evangelical, full of the very spirit of
the Gospel.&nbsp; As some of his old-fashioned hearers used to
say, &lsquo;You could always reckon on sixteen ounces to the
pound.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Clayton was an exemplary pastor.&nbsp; After he removed to
Camomile Street and the Poultry, he visited his people in a most
methodical way, dividing London into districts, and going from
house to house, week after week, to comfort sorrowing hearts, to
share in domestic joys, to guide the perplexed, and to stimulate
the lukewarm; this I know, and therefore it may be <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>inferred that
he looked well after the few sheep in the Kensington fields,
feeding them by day, and watching over them by night.&nbsp; He
used to talk of the large &ldquo;ring fence&rdquo; round his
church in the city; the ring fence round his church in the suburb
was small, and hence we may be sure that his pastoral duties
were, during his pastorate at Hornton Street, thoroughly
performed.&nbsp; A gentleman by birth and education, with large
sympathies easily evoked, tears and smiles coming at a
moment&rsquo;s bidding, apt at telling anecdotes, full of humour
if not wit, he was a companion loved in a circle wider than his
own congregation; his genial friendliness and neighbourly visits
helped no doubt to promote the cause of Evangelical
Nonconformity.</p>
<p>A number of minutes occur in the record of affairs, relative
to matters of a temporal kind, during Mr. Clayton&rsquo;s
ministry; but there are no entries relative to the admission of
members or other strictly religious proceedings.&nbsp; One
subject in particular excited the pastor&rsquo;s solicitude,
namely, that the chapel property should be put in trust, which
accordingly was done; and in connection with this many
discussions arose touching what was needful for discharging
pecuniary liabilities.&nbsp; It is plain from what follows that
Mr. Clayton was not satisfied with &ldquo;the mixture of
temporals with spirituals,&rdquo; as he called it; and on
Christmas Day, 1804, he publicly assigned reasons for
relinquishing the pastoral office.&nbsp; Various rumours were
afloat, which he briefly contradicted as &ldquo;untrue,&rdquo;
and then told his friends that if they <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>were asked &ldquo;Why has Mr. Clayton
left Kensington?&rdquo; they were to reply, &ldquo;That it was
his earnest wish to be nearer the immediate circle of his
ministerial connections and religious friends; that his desire
was to be united to a Church whose members more fully coincided
with him in sentiment on several subjects, more especially on the
sacrament of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper; and particularly that he
might find a place where he might not be habitually perplexed
with secular arrangements, and where he might in some degree
enjoy that tranquillity which he deemed so necessary in the
present state of his health.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have the
pleasure,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;to inform you all, that last
year this chapel was vested in the hands of nine trustees, who
are engaged to see that no minister shall ever be settled here
who does not preach the gospel agreeably to the tenets of the
Assembly&rsquo;s Catechism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Biggs, the collector and secretary, also resigned his
office, and Mr. Walker was appointed in his room.</p>
<p>On the 31st of October, 1805, it was resolved, &ldquo;at a
meeting held in the vestry,&rdquo; that Mr. Hamilton, of
Brighton, should be invited to become pastor, and an invitation
accordingly was drawn up, and signed by two deacons and between
eighty and ninety other persons.</p>
<p>To the invitation Mr. Hamilton sent a negative reply,
addressed to &ldquo;the Church of Christ assembling for religious
worship in Hornton Street, Kensington, and the subscribers to
that interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meetings afterwards occurred at intervals for the <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>settlement of
pecuniary affairs, until the month of January, 1807, when by the
direction of &ldquo;the managers, with the members and
subscribers approving,&rdquo; the secretary, Mr. Walker, wrote to
Mr. Leifchild, a student at Hoxton Academy, who had occupied
Kensington pulpit with great acceptance, to become minister of
the chapel.&nbsp; Mr. Leifchild replied that he could not leave
the Academy before the next Christmas, nor accept any call before
the next midsummer.&nbsp; In August of the same year a meeting
was held at Mr. Broadwood&rsquo;s house, and it was resolved to
secure Mr. Leifchild not less than &pound;160 per annum, with an
addition of whatever the chapel might bring in above that
sum.&nbsp; On the 3rd of January, 1808, the members of the chapel
resolved to invite Mr. Leifchild to the pastorate, and in March
he accepted the invitation.</p>
<h2><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>III.&nbsp; THE THIRD PASTORATE.<br />
<i>THE REV. DR. LEIFCHILD</i>.<br />
1808&ndash;1824.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Before</span> accepting the call to
Kensington,&rdquo; he said, as we learn from the Memoir by his
son, &ldquo;while returning from a visit to that place, I heard
at the house of a friend that Rowland Hill had announced me to
preach at Surrey Chapel on the following Tuesday
evening.&rdquo;&nbsp; He went and preached, and was surprised at
the risibility of the audience, which was explained when he heard
that Mr. Hill had crept up into the gallery behind the pulpit,
and in his own comical way expressed assent to one part and
dissent from another part of the discourse.&nbsp; The veteran
came into the vestry and asked the young man to become his curate
at Wotton-under-Edge.&nbsp; The latter declined the overture,
when the former replied, &ldquo;That reminds me of young men
setting up in business before they have served their
apprenticeship.&rdquo; <a name="citation37"></a><a
href="#footnote37" class="citation">[37]</a>&nbsp; Just before
that evening service, the minister of Surrey Chapel had written
to Mr. Wilson, Treasurer <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>of Hoxton Academy, saying, &ldquo;I
hear much of a young man of the name of Leifchild.&nbsp; It was
supposed that he was going to <i>settle</i> (a bad word for a
young recruiting spiritual officer) at Kensington; but that there
is a set of formal stupid Presbyterians there, who by no means
suit his taste, and that he is consequently still waiting for the
further directing hand of Providence, to know where he is to
go.&rdquo; <a name="citation38a"></a><a href="#footnote38a"
class="citation">[38a]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Hill was mistaken.&nbsp;
John Leifchild did <i>settle</i> at Kensington, and was ordained
there in June, 1808, when Dr. Simpson, his tutor, delivered the
charge.&nbsp; Dr. Simpson, it may be remarked, was a man of
singular spiritual power.&nbsp; Many can argue, illustrate,
persuade, and impress, but he could <i>inspire</i>; and the
accounts given of him in this respect by his students were
enthusiastic.&nbsp; &ldquo;I received a charge from his lips at
my ordination over the Church at Kensington,&rdquo; says his
admiring pupil, &ldquo;which I can never forget.&nbsp; Much of
the attention I afterwards met with in that official connection I
ascribe to the affectionate manner in which he addressed
me.&rdquo; <a name="citation38b"></a><a href="#footnote38b"
class="citation">[38b]</a></p>
<p>The new pastor does not give a flattering account of the
congregation which formed his maiden charge.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
was a great prejudice,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;in the town against
Dissenters.&nbsp; Many of my hearers resided at a distance or
held situations in London, and some of the managers of the
chapel, who were Scotchmen, were not very spiritual.&nbsp; Of the
deacons, some resided in London, <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>and one was very old.&nbsp; He also
was a Scotchman, but a very good man.&nbsp; He had been a
gardener on a nobleman&rsquo;s estate, and now lived on a small
income, respected for his piety and integrity.&nbsp; He was my
best help, but died after a long and lingering
illness.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;During that period I never found him
otherwise than pious, resigned, and cheerful.&nbsp; He always had
a guinea to spare for any religious object of importance,
although his income did not exceed &pound;50 per annum.&nbsp; One
of the managers was worth at least &pound;20,000, and was as
niggardly as Duncan was generous.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here,
Duncan,&rsquo; exclaimed this wealthy man, on the occasion of an
important collection at the chapel, &lsquo;Here, Duncan, will you
put this in the plate for me?&rsquo; handing two
half-crowns.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will, sir,&rsquo; replied Duncan,
&lsquo;<i>with my own guinea</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; This was said with
a good intent, but it hardly agreed with the Master&rsquo;s
precept, &lsquo;Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand
doeth.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within little more than a year after the new pastor&rsquo;s
settlement, George the Third&rsquo;s jubilee was held,&mdash;an
event which of course produced excitement in Kensington, for
whilst the royal old gentleman was popular all over the country,
beyond what the present generation is apt to believe, he stood
particularly high in the affections of the Kensingtonians, who
were familiar with his face and figure, as he dashed along in his
coach and four, attended by his body guard, through the Court
suburb.&nbsp; The cry of his approach, and the distant sight of
the soldiers and outriders brought people to the front, lifting
their hats <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>as he passed by.&nbsp; With Dissenters he was especially
popular, and the Hornton Street congregation loved him all the
more because he liked Saunders, the coachman, and read his
tracts.&nbsp; So in the loyal demonstrations of October, 1809,
they came prominently forward, and established on the 25th of the
month a school for &ldquo;children of both sexes and of all
religious denominations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon after the jubilee had been celebrated, the Nonconformist
part of English Christendom was thrown into excitement by Lord
Sidmouth&rsquo;s Bill for abridging the liberty of preaching,
under pretence of rectifying an abuse.&nbsp; He complained that
licences to preach were sought in order to evade parish duties
and militia service, and urged that there should be put upon
grants of licence certain restrictions which Dissenters did not
approve.&nbsp; The deputies of the three denominations rose in
determined opposition to this intermeddling with religious
liberty, and petitions against it poured into the Houses of
Parliament.&nbsp; The Kensington people joined other
Nonconformists in resisting the mischievous scheme, and promised
the London committee &ldquo;the utmost assistance and cordial
co-operation&rdquo;; they also subscribed towards defraying
expenses incurred by this &ldquo;well meant and well timed&rdquo;
assertion of religious freedom. <a name="citation40"></a><a
href="#footnote40" class="citation">[40]</a></p>
<p>Amongst the families connected with the Church during Dr.
Leifchild&rsquo;s pastorate, two in particular may <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>be mentioned,
noteworthy on their own account, and whom I can describe from
personal knowledge.</p>
<p>The Talfourds attended for some years.&nbsp; The mother was
one of those saintly women who when once seen can never be
forgotten.&nbsp; She belonged to the class of matrons
immortalized by Solomon.&nbsp; &ldquo;The heart of her husband
doth safely trust in her.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;She openeth her
mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of
kindness.&nbsp; She looketh well to the ways of her household,
and eateth not the bread of idleness.&nbsp; Her children arise
up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth
her.&rdquo;&nbsp; All this is eminently true of Mrs. Talfourd;
and there she used to sit and listen to her pastor in one of the
square green pews at Hornton Street, with her &ldquo;children
about her&rdquo;; one of whom, when a matron and mother, was,
during my own ministry, a comfort and a joy.&nbsp; The most
distinguished of her sons&mdash;others became distinguished in
other ways&mdash;was Mr. Justice Talfourd, who for some time not
only adorned the judicial bench, but before doing so made a mark
on literature and politics, by authorship and eloquence.&nbsp;
The good old lady told me of his boyish days, of his school-life
at Mill Hill; read to me one of his letters, in which he spoke of
his school-fellows, especially &ldquo;one Hamilton,&rdquo; who
joined a party that met for worship privately, and was
&ldquo;very flowery in his prayers.&rdquo;&nbsp; This Hamilton
was no other than the subsequently famous Nonconformist minister
of Leeds.&nbsp; The young barrister wrote an article on pulpit
oratory, <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>in which he fully described the preacher to whom he
listened on Sundays:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. Leifchild is one of those who feels
&lsquo;the future in the instant.&rsquo;&nbsp; He has almost as
intense a consciousness of the world to come as he has of the
visible objects around him.&nbsp; He speaks not only as
believing, but as <i>seeing</i> that which is invisible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His manner of level speaking is slovenly, sometimes
bordering on the familiar; but when he is aroused he pours forth
a torrent of voice and energy, and sustains it without
intermission to the end.&nbsp; His whole soul seems thrown into
every word.&nbsp; He does not stop to explain his expressions, or
give all his qualifications to his doctrines which he might think
requisite in a confession of faith, but gives full vent to the
predominant feeling, and allows no other to check its course,
which in every kind of oratory is wise.&nbsp; He thus
occasionally, it is true, rushes headlong against some tremendous
stumbling-block, or approaches that fine division where the pious
borders on the profane.&nbsp; But, on the whole, the greatest
effect is produced by this abandonment to the honest impulse of
the season.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; says Mr. Leifchild, &ldquo;that my
father told me, upon his return from the Serjeant&rsquo;s house
in Russell Square, where he had been dining, that this then
well-known orator of the law courts had relaxed and refreshed
himself by referring to the old Kensington days, and the old
chapel, and singularly enough, the old hymns of Dr. Watts, which
he had once rather disdained.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you
remember,&rsquo; said he to my father, &lsquo;how we used to sing
that hymn&mdash;one of Watts&rsquo;s best&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When I survey the wondrous cross<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On which the Prince of Glory died,<br />
My richest gain I count my loss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And pour contempt on all my pride&rdquo;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>And do
you remember how heartily we used to join in the last verse:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Were the whole realm of nature mine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That were a present far too small;<br />
Love so amazing, so Divine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Demands my soul, my life, my
all.&rdquo;&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another family, less known to fame, was Mrs. Bergne, of
Brompton Row, and her two sons.&nbsp; The eldest of them was John
Bergne, for fifty years clerk in the Foreign Office, and during
the latter part of the time superintendent of the French
department,&mdash;an office which brought him into association
with many foreign and home celebrities.&nbsp; A man of high
culture, great conversational power and exuberant wit, he was
nevertheless decidedly religious, and remained steadfast in his
nonconformity to the end of life.&nbsp; He was a most attentive
hearer, and wrote down many of his pastor&rsquo;s sermons,
chiefly from memory.&nbsp; He carefully preserved two quarto
volumes filled with a course of lectures on &ldquo;The
Acts,&rdquo; which I read when I was young, and they gave me a
good idea of the preaching then heard at Hornton Street.&nbsp; A
younger son, Samuel, entered the ministry during Dr.
Vaughan&rsquo;s pastorate, and with him, as well as his brother
John, I enjoyed a lifelong friendship most intimate, most
endeared.&nbsp; He became well known as pastor of the Poultry
Chapel, and as Secretary of the British and Foreign Bible
Society.&nbsp; The family lived at Brompton, but year after year
made their way morning and evening to Kensington Chapel; and <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>with them I
may couple the family of the Gainsfords, who resided in
Piccadilly.&nbsp; Such circumstances show the distances which in
those days people walked to the house of God.&nbsp; It is
remarkable how many branches of old Nonconformist families
included in our history have since risen to eminence.&nbsp; Here
I may mention Dr. Bruce, the learned arch&aelig;ologist in
Newcastle, who married Miss Gainsford; also their son, the
present Recorder of Bradford.</p>
<p>Another family may also be mentioned, though not I believe
members of the Church, as were most of those whom I have just
recorded:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Amongst the attendants on his ministry
(says Mr. John Leifchild, speaking of his father) were Lord and
Lady Molesworth.&nbsp; They had derived benefit from his pulpit
instruction, and became his attached friends.&nbsp; He often
referred in particular to the mother, Lady Molesworth, a truly
pious elderly lady, who had apartments in Kensington
Palace.&nbsp; She had two strong reasons for her attachment to my
father&rsquo;s ministry: one being the benefit which she herself
had obtained from it; and the other being the influence which it
had exercised on a favourite son&mdash;Lord Molesworth.&nbsp;
Lord Molesworth, her younger son, had heard Mr. Leifchild at
Hornton Street Chapel, and though very wild and thoughtless at
that time, was so affected by what he heard as to alter his mode
of life.&nbsp; Another, and the elder son, was then in India,
where, being laid on a sick bed, he remembered the psalms which
his father, Viscount Molesworth, had read and expounded when he
was a child at home, showing their reference to the Messiah, and
thus confirming the truth of Scripture.&nbsp; I believe he came
home, and it was then that he also attended the ministry at
Hornton Street Chapel.&nbsp; He now became devoted and useful;
and having obtained an appointment in Ceylon, he repaired
thither, and there continued his usefulness by distributing
religious publications.&nbsp; His father dying, he succeeded to
the title, and having acquired property in Ceylon, he determined
<a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>to return
home, assist at the chapel, and spend the remainder of his days
with his aged mother.&nbsp; He notified to his mother the time of
his embarkation, and she, calculating the length of the voyage,
expected at a certain day to enfold her son in her embrace.&nbsp;
She was disappointed, and the reason soon appeared in the
reception of the melancholy intelligence that the vessel in which
he had trusted himself, his wife, and all his acquisitions, had
gone down at sea, and every life had been lost.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
feared,&rsquo; says my father, &lsquo;on hearing the sad news, to
call upon her; but on doing so I found her calm.&nbsp; And with
erect and majestic figure, looking at me, she said: &ldquo;Dear
pastor, God sustains me.&nbsp; I utter not a murmuring
word.&nbsp; The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away: blessed
be the name of the Lord.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I first went to Kensington, I was requested to visit an
old member of the Church, a shoemaker by trade, who I learnt had
been converted under the ministry of Dr. Leifchild.&nbsp; I went
and found him bedridden.&nbsp; He was a remarkable man, with a
handsome face, but a cripple.&nbsp; In very humble circumstances,
and uneducated, except in things pertaining to the kingdom of
God, he had a good deal of that natural politeness which appeared
all the more striking from its humble surroundings.&nbsp; He won
my affections; and I delighted to sit by the good man&rsquo;s bed
when he would describe, in emphatic language and with strong
emotion, his strange life-story.&nbsp; Good-tempered from a boy,
ready for fun and frolic, and of a daring spirit, he plunged one
day, if I remember right, into the thick of the traffic in the
high road, and was so crushed under a cart wheel, that it was a
wonder he survived the accident.&nbsp; He had mixed with
dissolute company, and been accustomed, as he loitered about the
end of an alley opposite the <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>church, to insult those who passed by
on the way to worship.&nbsp; His habits did not improve when he
became a married man, and his notoriety for evil was a village
scandal.&nbsp; But two of his children went to the Sunday school,
and they persuaded their father to come to chapel.&nbsp; Dr.
Leifchild preached from the words of St. Jude: &ldquo;Preserved
in Jesus Christ, and called,&rdquo; and spoke of the remarkable
preservation of sinful people before they were called and
converted.&nbsp; He happened to relate an anecdote of Mr. Cecil,
who, previously to his becoming decidedly religious, narrowly
escaped with his life, when thrown by his horse across the track
of a wagon, which in passing only crushed his hat.&nbsp; The
incident struck the listener.&nbsp; It resembled his own
experience, and rivetted his attention.&nbsp; When the preacher
followed up the illustration with a characteristic appeal,
addressed to such as were still unconverted after signal
providential deliverances, the cripple trembled from head to
foot.&nbsp; Greatly impressed, he went to chapel again and again,
till he found himself another man, &ldquo;a new creature in
Christ Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; He would weep as he told the story,
and go on to speak of his subsequent spiritual joy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am a wonder unto many,&rdquo; he would say, and then
sing:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Amazing grace! how sweet the sound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That saved a wretch like me;<br />
I once was lost, but now am found;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was blind, but now I see.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before I knew him a chair was made, in which he was <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>wheeled from
place to place, and was conveyed to the chapel where God&rsquo;s
grace touched his heart.&nbsp; He loved the memory of the
minister who had led him to Christ; and that minister relates:
&ldquo;Whenever he heard that I was about to re-visit the town,
which I had subsequently left for another sphere of labour, he
caused his little carriage to be wheeled out to meet me.&nbsp; I
saw his eyes glistening with emotion, and the tears rolling down
his cheeks, as I approached him, and then he invariably exclaimed
aloud, &lsquo;I am a wonder to many, sir; but God is my strong
refuge.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation47"></a><a
href="#footnote47" class="citation">[47]</a></p>
<p>This remarkable conversion came to be common talk, and reached
the ears of the Vicar, the Rev. Thomas Kennell.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Shortly afterwards (says Dr. Leifchild) the
Vicar called upon me and entered into familiar conversation with
me on the great truths of the Gospel, evidently as the result of
the impression which the shoemaker&rsquo;s wonderful conversion
had produced.&nbsp; Thenceforth his kindly feeling toward me
never decreased, and this was the more to be remarked on account
of his standing in the Episcopal Church, as respected his
learning, oratorical power, and zeal for God according to his
knowledge.&nbsp; He was comparatively young, but with a
magnanimous mind he had early determined to appreciate truth and
goodness wherever they were to be found, and to follow them
whithersoever they might lead.&nbsp; Soon afterwards he fell into
a decline, and one evening while we were holding a
prayer-meeting, news was brought us of his dangerous
illness.&nbsp; I immediately requested those who led our
devotions to bear him on their minds before God, and afterwards
desired that no mention might be made of this circumstance, as I
did not wish to draw attention to ourselves.&nbsp; But a report
of it reached his sick chamber, and shortly after, upon the
occasion <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>of his removal for the benefit of change of air, I
received from him the following note:</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>April</i> 29<i>th</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot leave Kensington without expressing to you my
grateful feelings for the truly kind and Christian manner in
which, during a very critical period of my illness, you were
pleased to direct the prayers of your congregation to the throne
of grace for my recovery.&nbsp; It has made a deep impression
upon my mind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Those prayers were mercifully heard, and, by the
blessing of God, I trust that I am in a state of progressive
amendment.&nbsp; Slow indeed have been my advances, insomuch that
even now I am totally incapable of the ordinary exertions of
life; but I trust that a good Providence, whose mercies have
indeed been around my path and about my bed, will, in His good
time, perform the perfect work of restoration.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another remarkable fact must not be passed by:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One sabbath morning (says the pastor) a
singular lapse of memory befell me, which I had never before and
have never since experienced.&nbsp; When I rose from sleep I
could not recollect any portion of the discourse which I had
prepared on the day before; and, what was most strange, I could
not even remember the text of the prepared sermon.&nbsp; I was
perplexed, and walked out before breakfast in Kensington
Gardens.&nbsp; While there a particular text occurred to my mind;
and my thoughts seemed to dwell on it so much that I resolved to
preach from that without further attempting to recall what I had
prepared, a thing which I had never ventured to do during all my
ministry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From this text I preached, and it was &lsquo;Weeping
may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the
morning.&rsquo;&nbsp; I preached with great liberty, and in the
course of the sermon I quoted the lines:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Beware of desperate steps! the darkest day&mdash;<br />
Live till to-morrow&mdash;will have passed away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I afterwards learned that a man in despair had that
very morning gone to the Serpentine to drown himself in it.&nbsp;
For this purpose he had filled his pockets with stones, hoping to
sink at once.&nbsp; Some passengers, however disturbed him while
on the brink, and he <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>returned to Kensington, intending to
drown himself in the dusk of the evening.&nbsp; On passing my
chapel he saw a number of people crowding into it, and thought he
would join them in order to pass away the time.&nbsp; His
attention was rivetted to the sermon, which seemed to be in part
composed for him; and when he heard me quote the lines alluded
to, he resolved to abandon his suicidal purpose.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another incident deserves relation:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A bricklayer came one evening drunk, yet
towards the close was impressed.&nbsp; The next Sunday he came
again, and I noticed him as one of the two young men who had
behaved rudely the Sabbath evening preceding; but he had been cut
to the heart.&nbsp; &lsquo;I,&rsquo; said he to himself,
&lsquo;am the man intended.&rsquo;&nbsp; He soon fell ill, when
the good work deepened.&nbsp; He is now consistent.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Leifchild left a list of thirty-two persons to whom he had
been useful, and under each name a notice of particulars
connected with it. <a name="citation49"></a><a href="#footnote49"
class="citation">[49]</a></p>
<p>There lived in one of the stately houses in Kensington Gore a
gentleman, commanding in person and polished in manners, who was
drawn towards the Dissenting pastor, though he had no affection
for Dissenters.&nbsp; &ldquo;He laughed at <i>them</i> and liked
<i>him</i>.&nbsp; He was a staunch churchman, but came
occasionally to the chapel, where, as also in other places, he
might be distinguished by the flower always fastened in the
buttonhole of his coat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the table of this hospitable gentleman the Kensington
pastor met Serjeant Goulburn, then a young man; Mr. Stephen, of
anti-slavery renown and Wilberforce&rsquo;s friend; Miss
Edgeworth, the novelist; and the <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>John Owen, early Secretary of the
Bible Society.&nbsp; The cheerful host experienced a great
reverse, lost a fortune on the Stock Exchange, but bore it with
equanimity, saying, when he came home and was asked by his wife
how he was, &ldquo;Pretty well, my love, for a ruined
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Leifchild, through the medium of rich
neighbours, befriended him in his trouble, for which he was ever
afterwards grateful; and in subsequent years I enjoyed the
friendship of one of his daughters, who with her husband, a
Governor of the Bank of England, attended Hornton Street Chapel
when I was minister.&nbsp; Her sisters also, who attained rank
and fortune, always felt kindly towards the place where their
father worshipped; but I knew nothing at that time of the
circumstances respecting him described in the &ldquo;Life of Dr.
Leifchild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Leifchild met with curious characters in Kensington:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Honourable Mrs. S&mdash; lived next
door to him.&nbsp; One morning she said to him, looking over the
garden wall, &lsquo;Leifchild, can I come in; I want to speak to
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Certainly, Mrs. S&mdash;,&rsquo; was the reply,
and they were soon together in my father&rsquo;s parlour, when
the following conversation took place, the lady commencing
abruptly as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Leifchild, I want a spade.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A <i>spade</i>, madam!&rsquo; exclaimed her
neighbour in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, a spade!&rsquo; was the rejoinder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But, Mrs. S&mdash;, your garden is always in
good order.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nonsense! you know what I mean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I will send the servant round with a
spade.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nonsense! you know I do not mean
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Excuse me, Mrs. S&mdash;, I really do not know
what you mean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, then, you frightened me yesterday by
saying that very few were converted after fifty years of age, and
I am now forty-nine.&nbsp; <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>And then you spoke of the diligent
husbandman, and said we must all set to work.&nbsp; Now, I mean
to work, and that is why I want a spade.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You shall have one, madam, and gladly too.&nbsp;
We have abundance of work, and shall be most thankful for your
help.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation51"></a><a
href="#footnote51" class="citation">[51]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prosperity attended the labours of Dr. Leifchild.&nbsp; The
congregation greatly increased; galleries had to be erected and
enlarged; and the income, once estimated at &pound;160 a year,
rose to more than double that amount.&nbsp; Many were admitted to
communion, but in what way exactly does not appear, as the record
of affairs respecting that period deals more in temporal than
spiritual matters.&nbsp; No ecclesiastical contentions, properly
so called, ruffled the stream; but there seem to have been
frequent debates in the vestry about the state of the exchequer
as regards paying for the gallery, and defraying other incidental
expenses.&nbsp; Music created more serious strife.&nbsp; Mr.
Broadwood, naturally enough, wished for an instrument to help the
singing, and liberally offered to place an organ in the chapel,
which Mr. Grey, a more true blue Presbyterian, did not
approve.&nbsp; Correspondence arose and vestry meetings were
held, in all of which Mr. Broadwood appears to have acted most
kindly, but the conscientious scruples of his colleague could not
be overcome.&nbsp; The latter left the chapel, and ultimately an
organ was erected; but that did not end all trouble, for the
organist incurred criticism; and whilst some good folks aimed at
musical <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>harmony, they were the occasion of considerable social
discord.&nbsp; It is the old story; but no serious division
occurred, and after a slight storm there came a pleasant
calm.</p>
<p>In our historical sketch it would be bad taste to pry into
domestic secrets, but the married life of Dr. Leifchild was so
mixed up with the interests of the congregation, that this part
of our narrative would be incomplete if no notice was taken of
Mrs. Leifchild.&nbsp; She was his second wife, whom he married
during this his first pastorate, and the idea he entertained of
this excellent lady appears in memoirs of her from his own pen,
entitled, &ldquo;The Minister&rsquo;s Helpmeet.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
lightened his cares by undertaking, at his request, the
management of pecuniary matters, in which, according to his
son&rsquo;s account, he does not appear to have been particularly
skilful.&nbsp; &ldquo;He abhorred all figures, but those of
speech, and the latter were too unsubstantial for the support of
a household.&nbsp; He would prefer any book to his bank book (a
figure of speech, for in truth he never required one); and though
not to be accused of extravagance, he certainly was chargeable
with some thoughtlessness.&rdquo; <a name="citation52"></a><a
href="#footnote52" class="citation">[52]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;She was
a shrewd, discerning woman, with a keen insight into
character&mdash;a quality of priceless value in a
minister&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; She was generally correct in her
opinions of people, and her boldly pronounced forecasts of merits
and demerits in the circle of her acquaintance made a deep
impression on her family, whatever <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>might be thought of them outside if
revealed, which one would hope they were not always.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Her share in conducting the psalmody, visiting the congregation,
and promoting religious and charitable objects was a topic of
talk for years after she left the neighbourhood; and the mutual
affection of the genial couple supplied materials for pleasant
reminiscences in the minds of many an old friend.&nbsp; Dr.
Morison, of Brompton, used to relate how he walked home from
Kensington one old year&rsquo;s night or new year&rsquo;s
morning, as the moon shone brightly over the frosty road, and
hearing in the distance musical voices, he found, as he came
nearer, that two people were singing,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Come, let us anew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our journey pursue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Roll round with the year,<br />
And never stand still till the Master appear.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What was Dr. Morison&rsquo;s surprise to find at last that the
words proceeded from the lips of the Kensington pastor and his
wife.&nbsp; As she was beloved of him, so he was beloved of
her.&nbsp; I have heard her in later days extol, in no measured
terms, the excellences of his preaching, and also tell how she
liked to accompany him to village services, and visit cottages in
the neighbourhood, beating up recruits for the rustic
congregation.&nbsp; Once, after a sermon in a little country
chapel, I saw her go into the vestry and lovingly kiss the old
prophet, exclaiming with genuine fervour, &ldquo;God bless you,
John.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such affection and admiration in an ancient
lady seem <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>to me truly beautiful, and I trust no reader will think
the incident two trivial to be noticed here.</p>
<p>Some difference of judgment between the pastor and managers
respecting the mode of meeting incidental expenses led to a
conference, when Dr. Leifchild hinted at the possibility of his
removing.&nbsp; He did not approve of the management scheme, and
the managers immediately retired.&nbsp; Their letter of
resignation was accepted at a Church meeting in December,
1821.&nbsp; It was in August, 1824, that he received an
invitation from Bristol, and his acceptance of it he thus
intimated to his people:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. Leifchild addressed the meeting, and
stated that, from a variety of circumstances, he had seen it his
duty to accept of an invitation to the pastoral office of Bridge
Street, Bristol.&nbsp; He assured the meeting that this step
arose from no uncomfortableness in his present situation inducing
a wish to depart; from no decay in the interest here; no want of
attendance; no diminution in the affections of the people; nor
from any pecuniary motives, as the salary proposed at Bristol was
the same which he received here, &pound;350 per annum, and that
he had no prospect of its increase there which he had not
here.&nbsp; But his chief motives were the state of his health,
which he hoped might be improved by a residence at a greater
distance from the metropolis; the prospect of more extensive
usefulness at that city; and above all, many indications to his
mind that such was the will of Providence.&nbsp; He concluded by
requesting any one who was not satisfied, and wished for further
information, to put any question to him to that effect, as he had
nothing to conceal.&nbsp; No question having been put, the
meeting was dissolved with prayer.&rdquo; <a
name="citation54"></a><a href="#footnote54"
class="citation">[54]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Leifchild might well be proud of her husband; and here,
in conclusion, let me repeat what I have said elsewhere: his
sermons were constructed upon the <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>principle of reaching a climax in the
peroration.&nbsp; All prepared for that, and he used to lay down
this maxim for pulpit oratory: &ldquo;Begin low, proceed slow;
rise higher, catch fire; be self-possessed when most
impressed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Though he produced wonderful effects at
public meetings, the pulpit was his throne, where he ruled his
audience with a kind of imperial sway.&nbsp; His skill in the
introduction of religious topics into common conversation was
very remarkable, and he abounded in anecdotes illustrative of
scripture truth and spiritual experience.&nbsp; On his death bed
he fancied himself entering within the everlasting doors, and
exclaimed, &ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you hear it, those beautiful
harps?&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t all go in with me.&nbsp; I must go
first; but keep close behind me, and open the gates wide, wide,
wide for all.&rdquo;&nbsp; On his tombstone are inscribed these
words of his own: &ldquo;I will creep as well as I can to Thy
gates.&nbsp; I will die at Thy door.&nbsp; Yea, I will be found
dead on the threshold of Thy mercy, with the ring of that door in
my hand.&rdquo; <a name="citation55"></a><a href="#footnote55"

57</span>IV.&nbsp; THE FOURTH PASTORATE.<br />
<i>THE REV. ROBERT VAUGHAN</i>, <i>D.D.</i><br />
1825&ndash;1843.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Leifchild</span> relinquished the
pastorate in August, 1824.&nbsp; Dr. Vaughan received a
&ldquo;call&rdquo; signed by about eighty members, and this he
accepted in February, 1825.&nbsp; His acceptance is dated from
Worcester.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;without
being truly thankful for the many blessings which have
accompanied my religious connection in this city that I yield to
the influence of circumstances, which in my own view and that of
the more judicious of my friends, fully warrant the step which I
now take in freely stating my acceptance of your call.&nbsp; I
do, however, wish you, my dear friends, to be fully aware that I
have not dared to proceed thus far without confiding greatly in
your deeper sympathies, and more fervent prayers in my
behalf.&nbsp; The doctrines I have preached in your hearing will
never I trust lose their prominence in my ministry.&nbsp; To my
own heart they yield its best, its only stay, and to apply them
as a balm of never-failing efficacy to your spirits is what <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>I now propose
as the one object of my life while continued as your
pastor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Vaughan was not educated at any of our colleges, but
studied under the Reverend William Thorp, of Bristol,&mdash;a
man, the breadth of whose intellect might be said to be
symbolized by the extraordinary portliness of his figure.&nbsp;
As there was much nobility in his nature, he might, in that
respect, be likened to a monarch of the forest,&mdash;with this
additional and curious resemblance, that whereas a lion rejoices
in having two cubs at a time, so the leonine Bristol pastor never
had but two pupils under his care, and they came both at
once&mdash;Robert Vaughan and John Jukes.&nbsp; The latter
presided over John Bunyan&rsquo;s Church at Bedford; and I have
heard him and his friend at Kensington crack obvious jokes on
their relationship to each other, and to their remarkable
instructor.&nbsp; After entering on the ministry, Dr. Vaughan
spent six years at Worcester in hard study, preparing himself for
what he afterwards became.&nbsp; There he took an honourable
position, but it could scarcely at first be augured that he would
rise to be what he ultimately was.</p>
<p>He was intensely devoted to reading, especially in the
historical department of literature, and of this he gave some
presage as a boy when, at the age of twelve, he carried home
triumphantly Raleigh&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of the World,&rdquo;
on the purchase of which he had invested a birthday gift.&nbsp;
He largely overcame early defects in education; and by dint of
extraordinary diligence, acquired <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>large stores of historical
learning.&nbsp; His tastes did not lie in the same direction as
Dr. Leifchild&rsquo;s, and he never became the popular preacher
which his predecessor was; though on the platform, in depth of
thought, range of argument, and sometimes brilliancy of
illustration, he surpassed him.&nbsp; Every man in his own
order.&nbsp; The one excelled in appeals to the head, the other
in appeals to the heart.&nbsp; Each did a vast deal of good in
the Great Master&rsquo;s service.</p>
<p>The recognition, or &ldquo;ordination,&rdquo; as it is called,
of the new pastor took place on the 5th of May, 1825.&nbsp; The
Reverend Joseph Hughes, of Battersea, the Nonconformist Secretary
of the British and Foreign Bible Society, and a friend of
Leifchild&mdash;who wrote interesting memoirs of his
life&mdash;opened the service with Scripture reading and
prayers.&nbsp; Dr. Winter, of New Court, one of the leading city
ministers, &ldquo;stated the nature of a Gospel Church&rdquo;;
Dr. Waugh offered the ordination prayer, for which his wonderful
&ldquo;gift in prayer&rdquo; eminently fitted him; Dr. Fletcher,
of Stepney, &ldquo;an eloquent man,&rdquo; delivered the charge;
and George Clayton preached to the people.</p>
<p>Kensington was considerably changed when the new pastor
reached it.&nbsp; The suburb was much more populous than of
yore.&nbsp; Streets and squares, terraces and crescents were
rising and stretching here and there; but the town, as it was now
called, remained compact.&nbsp; Beyond the turnpike road, then
bordered by only single lines of houses, there spread out north

60</span>wide border country of market gardens and orchards; and
my predecessor told me of his dreary walks in winter, from his
residence on Notting Hill to Hornton Street Chapel.&nbsp; No good
pavement, no gas-lighted lamps, existed then; and the wayfarer
was left to pick his path as best he could on pitch dark
evenings, across Campden Hill, helped only by a glimmering
lantern carried in his hand.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the Kensington records supply scanty information
respecting the Vaughan period,&mdash;the years between November,
1825, and November, 1832, being passed over without one single
line; whilst before and after, secular concerns are the chief
subjects of entry.&nbsp; Now the appointment of new managers,
then the retirement of a secretary, next the letting of pews;
and, as a variation, the erection of a tablet in the chapel to
the memory of a departed hearer.&nbsp; These are the topics which
occur on the pages of the old parchment-bound volume.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;History of Kensington&rdquo; supplies a list of the
institutions existing in connection with Hornton Street just
before the close of Dr. Leifchild&rsquo;s ministry, and these
continued in working order under Dr. Vaughan.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A Benevolent Society, for visiting,
instructing, and relieving the sick poor of all descriptions, at
their own habitations, and which is at present chiefly conducted
by ladies belonging to the congregation.&nbsp; A Tract Society,
for the dispersion of religious tracts by the subscribers, to
whom they are furnished at reduced prices.&nbsp; A Blanket
Society, for the gratuitous distribution of blankets to the poor
during the severity of the winter season.&nbsp; The
Infants&rsquo; Friendly Society,&mdash;a <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>female
institution, which provides clothing and nourishment for poor
women and their children during their confinement.&nbsp; An
Auxiliary Missionary Society, to assist in the propagation of the
Gospel in foreign parts, and which, by means of contributions of
one penny per week (and upwards), raises the sum of nearly one
hundred pounds per annum.&nbsp; Besides these, collections are
made at the chapel for the Hoxton Academy; and every severe
winter, on a smaller scale, to assist in relieving the poor of
the parish.&rdquo; <a name="citation61"></a><a href="#footnote61"
class="citation">[61]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Auxiliary Missionary Society greatly increased its
contributions under the new pastorate, and before Dr. Vaughan
left they were, I believe, more than doubled.&nbsp; I remember
attending a missionary meeting in Hornton Street, soon after I
entered the ministry in 1832, when a large attendance in the
chapel, a well-filled platform, and energetic speeches by the
pastor in the chair and by others, bore ample witness to the
missionary spirit which was reigning in the place.&nbsp; One
family in particular, at a later period, was distinguished by
zeal for the conversion of the heathen, and did perhaps more than
any other to fan the flame of missionary benevolence.&nbsp; I
allude to the Newtons, who&mdash;with their father, a deacon in
the Church, and their mother, who was indeed &ldquo;a mother in
Israel&rdquo;&mdash;held a foremost place, not only in this
respect, but in other works of faith and labours of love.&nbsp;
Being warmly attached to Dr. Vaughan, they all, parents and
children, held up his hands and cheered his heart.&nbsp; One of
Mr. Newton&rsquo;s daughters, in my time, was married to the Rev.
J. H. Budden, a valuable missionary at Mirzapore; and it was
during Dr. Vaughan&rsquo;s administration <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>that this
excellent man, then I think a member of the Church, had devoted
himself to the London Missionary Society, of which, down to the
present day, he has remained a distinguished agent.&nbsp; The
young lady he married, and her sisters, were indefatigable as
collectors for Foreign Missions; and I have often thought what a
blessing it is for a congregation to have such helpers; not only
because they themselves feed streams of holy Christian charity,
but because by example and social influence they stimulate the
usefulness of others.&nbsp; A sister of Mr. Budden&rsquo;s, also
connected with Kensington, became the wife of Mr. Birt, a
missionary who laboured assiduously and successfully in South
Africa; and it was a sad calamity for the Mission, and her family
at home, when, in early life, she was killed by an accident,
whilst travelling with her husband in a bullock wagon over an
African wild.</p>
<p>The Tract Society mentioned in the list just now cited
developed into a new form.&nbsp; The Christian Instruction
Society came into existence, and was energetically taken up by
Dr. Vaughan and his friends; meetings used to be regularly held,
when the visitors attended to report their labours, and to
receive small sums out of funds collected for relieving poor
people in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The Sunday School also received large attention and support
from the Newton family.&nbsp; I believe that all the members were
in the schools, either as teachers or scholars; the mother being
a model teacher, whose praise in the congregation, amongst some
of the old <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>members, has echoed down to this very day.&nbsp;
Kensington furnishes many illustrations of that inspired saying,
&ldquo;The memory of the just is blessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sunday School anniversary, at the end of March, was a high
day.&nbsp; Just as the spring buds began to burst in the
hedgerows which lined the opposite side of the road, crowds of
youngsters, full of springtide hope and joy, were seen crowding
within the doors to take part in the yearly festival.&nbsp; The
boys occupied the gallery on one side, the girls filled the
other.&nbsp; The little maidens on these occasions wore white
caps, of which they were rather proud, but as they were often
criticised, the practice of putting them on was entirely dropped
about the year 1845.&nbsp; The singing of special hymns by
childish voices was a constant accompaniment, and to many a great
attraction.</p>
<p>Whilst these forms of usefulness went on in immediate
connection with the Church, outside of it stood two institutes of
a thoroughly catholic description&mdash;the British School and
the Bible Society.</p>
<p>At the back of the old chapel were buildings occupied by the
British School, where a large number of boys and girls were
educated upon unsectarian principles.&nbsp; Church people and
Dissenters united in their support, but the latter were
foremost.&nbsp; Elementary education at that period was largely
promoted by the voluntary efforts of the British and the National
School Societies; the first of these rallying round it the ranks
of Dissent, the second being a pillar of strength in the
Established <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>Church.&nbsp; The minister and deacons at Hornton Street
took special interest in the Kensington British School.</p>
<p>The British and Foreign Bible Society had a large auxiliary
for many years, comprehending a district which reached over both
Westminster and the Court suburb.&nbsp; The annual meetings
originally were held in the Haymarket, sometimes under the
presidency of Royal Dukes, when, during the period of Dr.
Leifchild&rsquo;s ministry, he would be sure to be present, and
make telling speeches in his own characteristic style.&nbsp; In
the latter period of his pastorate, I believe, the district
narrowed; certainly in Dr. Vaughan&rsquo;s time the auxiliary had
formed itself into distinct branches, and the Kensington one was
wont to hold its own meetings.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s Arms, by
the palace gates had an assembly room in which the friends of the
Bible Society used to meet in Dr. Vaughan&rsquo;s days, and there
he did not fail by his sonorous eloquence impressively to commend
the circulation of the Holy Scriptures throughout the world, as
equally a Christian duty and a Christian privilege.&nbsp; On the
platform, especially in later years, on denominational and
patriotic questions, he often surpassed himself.&nbsp; The light
from under his knitted brow, his compressed lips, his lordly
bearing, his significant attitude and graceful
gestures&mdash;something dramatic appeared in his oratory on such
occasions&mdash;revealed much out of the ordinary way, and raised
in listeners high expectations, which were rarely
disappointed.</p>
<p>Dr. Vaughan spent more time at home than in visiting <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>his people,
not always to the satisfaction of the latter; but his profiting
appeared unto all men, and his more intelligent hearers
appreciated the results of his diligent study.&nbsp; He gradually
rose into fame as an author, and his &ldquo;Life of
Wickliffe&rdquo; won for him a high reputation.&nbsp; Other
historical works, which it is needless to specify, made him still
more widely known, and literary men honoured the Kensington
pastor as an ornament to their profession.&nbsp; His authorship
led to his London University professorship.&nbsp; History was his
<i>forte</i>, and as Professor of Modern History in the new
academical institute, he did good service.&nbsp; All these
laurels served to attract thoughtful and cultivated people to
Hornton Street.&nbsp; Inferior in numbers to many, the
congregation, perhaps, in reference to the educated class, was
inferior to none.&nbsp; Some of the aristocracy might now and
then, during the latter part of his ministry, and afterwards, be
seen within the humble walls.&nbsp; The Duchess of Sutherland and
Lady Mary Fox were, I know, great admirers of the Doctor; and the
former of these ladies&mdash;so queen-like in her appearance and
manners&mdash;was once, I am told, present at a prayer meeting in
the little Kensington schoolroom.&nbsp; The pastor was thankful
to have opportunities of usefulness amongst people of rank, but
he had no idea of flattering the great and seeking their
patronage.&nbsp; I am quite sure from what I knew of him, and
from conversation on the subject, he valued an occasional
attendance of distinguished persons, much talked of at the time,
only on account of the good <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>he hoped to do them, not at all on
account of any assistance they rendered, or any
<i>&eacute;clat</i> they conferred.&nbsp; Though of humble
extraction, he was one of Nature&rsquo;s nobility, without
assumption or servility, he could bear himself well amongst the
noblest of the land.</p>
<p>One word ought to be said about his son&mdash;a member of the
Church, and whom I think I now see sitting in the table pew, with
his intellectual face, and long raven locks, looking up with
loving eyes to his parent and pastor.&nbsp; The Doctor was proud
of his son, and well he might be.&nbsp; But thankfulness for such
a treasure went beyond all pride.&nbsp; The youth won the praises
of such men as Sir James Stephen and Charles Kingsley, and had he
been spared he would have proved a great blessing to the Church
of God.&nbsp; But his &ldquo;sun went down whilst it was yet
day,&rdquo; and this bereavement proved the greatest trial and
sorrow of the father&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; The son resembled the
father, not much in his mental habits, but very much in his
pulpit appearance and manners.&nbsp; I remember an old deacon
saying, after he had heard &ldquo;Alfy,&rdquo; as his father
called him, preach for me after I came to Kensington,
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a chip of the old block.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was in the year 1843 that Dr. Vaughan received an
invitation to become Principal of Lancashire Independent
College.&nbsp; Immediately afterwards a special meeting of the
Church was held, and it is thus reported in the
records:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The letter of the Rev. Dr. Raffles,
chairman of the committee, containing the invitation, was read,
and reference was made by Dr. <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>Vaughan to circumstances which seemed
to make his continuance in Kensington desirable and important,
and to others which went to give a strong claim to the call from
Manchester.&nbsp; It was intimated in conclusion, that the
meeting had been called, not for the purpose of giving
expression, at that time, to any opinion on either side of the
subject, but simply for the purpose of making the Church and
communicants aware of the various considerations which it would
be necessary carefully to weigh, in order to the formation of a
wise and Christian judgment on the subject.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is natural that the Kensington people should be reluctant
to part with such a pastor as they possessed; but, with a noble
unselfishness worthy of imitation, they thought as much of the
welfare of the Church at large as of their own.&nbsp; An extract
from the letter they sent to him deserves insertion:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It would be to our honour, and it would
afford us pleasure, to enumerate, as we could, other
considerations connected with your character and attainments
affecting the religious interests in this place, which might
naturally induce us to urge you to continue among us; but we feel
bound in this communication to deal faithfully as those who fear
God, the God of Truth, and we must therefore acknowledge, dear
sir, that while we are deeply pained at the possibility of your
leaving us, we are conscious that you possess moral and
intellectual qualities which eminently fit you to occupy the very
important post selected for you by your brethren in the ministry;
and as we value His blessing who alone can bless, we dare not, if
we could, interpose to prevent your acceptance of that
distinguished and honourable offer, if it shall appear to you to
be the will of God that you should accept it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soon after Dr. Vaughan had sent in his resignation, he wrote
to me inviting an interview for the purpose of ascertaining
whether there might be a likelihood of my leaving Windsor, where
I had been happily &ldquo;settled&rdquo; <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>for eleven
years.&nbsp; I was taken by surprise, though I had before
received intimations from brethren that it might be my duty to
undertake a sphere of wider service than I then occupied.&nbsp; I
could give no reply to Dr. Vaughan at the moment, but told him I
must at once consult my Windsor friends.&nbsp; This may seem
strange, but we had so much mutual affection and confidence, that
I could trust to their disinterestedness, whilst they trusted to
my attachment.&nbsp; The result was, after much anxious
conference, and the advice of two eminent brethren who happened
to be on a visit to Windsor, <a name="citation68"></a><a
href="#footnote68" class="citation">[68]</a> that I consented to
preach at Kensington, with a view to the pastorate.&nbsp; I had
no desire to leave Windsor.&nbsp; Far from it.&nbsp; I longed to
remain, if it were the will of God, and in that spirit prayed for
direction.&nbsp; After preaching a few times, I received a
cordial and unanimous invitation to Kensington, and the Windsor
Church agreed to my acceptance of it with expressions of unabated
affection, saying they knew I must leave them, and that if I went
away to so short a distance, there seemed more chance of their
seeing me often afterwards.&nbsp; The spirit manifested by the
Society left and the Society joined was so beautiful, that I
record the fact as expressive of my own gratitude, and as an
example worthy of imitation.&nbsp; Before Dr. Vaughan went into
Lancashire, steps had been taken with a view to this result, and
within two months it was accomplished.&nbsp; Some may think this
a <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>hasty
settlement; at all events it lasted for thirty-two years, with
growing affection on both sides.</p>
<p>The following letter of acceptance was written on the 27th of
July, 1843:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear
Brethren</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think it desirable to delay any longer than is
absolutely necessary a decided reply to the unanimous and
affectionate invitation which you have sent me, to accept the
pastoral office.&nbsp; It appears to me to be the path of duty to
remove from my present charge to the Church at Kensington.&nbsp;
Had I not been gradually prepared for this step, I do not think I
could have found it in my heart thus to sever the tie which has
pleasantly bound me for more than eleven years to my present
people; but the way has been opened by degrees, and the hand of
Providence has, I conceive, now placed me in a position, with
regard to you, from which it would not be proper to retreat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confiding in the sincerity of that approval and
affection which you are pleased to express, and above all,
looking up to the Fountain of all good, for His aid and blessing,
I venture to advance, and accept your united call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The spirit of supplication which has marked your
proceedings, in reference to this matter, gives me the strongest
ground to hope that in this instance the voice of the Church is
the voice of God.&nbsp; I am deeply sensible of the great
responsibility I incur in accepting so important a charge,
especially as the successor of one whose eminence in the
Christian world might well provoke, in relation to myself,
humiliating comparisons.&nbsp; But I rest on Him who can
successfully employ the humblest instrumentality in His
service.&nbsp; Let me hope that the spirit of prayer I have
already referred to may continue, and that you will earnestly
seek an enlarged effusion of Divine influence on my anticipated
labours.&nbsp; The consciousness of many infirmities and
imperfections compel me, at the very commencement of our new
relationship, to implore that you will ever manifest toward me
that candour and forbearance which I feel that I shall especially
need.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before I pass on to the new pastorate, it should be <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>stated, in
reference to Dr. Vaughan&rsquo;s ministry at Kensington, that for
some little time before his removal to Lancashire, the Rev. N.
Jennings, M.A., F.R.A.S., became associated with him as assistant
minister, and in that capacity he rendered important service,
especially in conducting Bible classes,&mdash;his instructions
were highly appreciated by the youthful members of the
congregation.</p>
<h2><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>V.&nbsp; THE FIFTH PASTORATE.<br />
<i>THE REV. JOHN STOUGHTON</i>, <i>D.D.</i><br />
1843&ndash;1875.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> new pastor felt his removal
from Windsor very deeply; and on the first Sunday of his regular
ministry in Kensington he was anything but
himself&mdash;certainly by no means at home.&nbsp; He thought
next day the people must have repented of their choice.&nbsp;
Matters, however, mended afterwards, though a good while passed
before he could accommodate himself to altered circumstances; but
the kindness he everywhere met with gave him increasing
encouragement.</p>
<p>A recognition service was held on October 31st, 1843, when his
old friend and neighbour, Dr. Morison, delivered an introductory
discourse; the late minister, Dr. Vaughan, gave the charge; and
his predecessor, Dr. Leifchild, addressed the congregation.&nbsp;
It was a pleasant circumstance that three successive pastors of
the same Church shared in the solemn service; and but for
uncontrollable hindrances, the predecessor of them <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>all, Mr.
Clayton, would have been present to assist.&nbsp; Dr.
Vaughan&rsquo;s charge was most impressive; and the allusion he
made to himself and his successor, as thenceforth associated like
fellow-workmen in the same edifice, was very striking from the
manner in which it was put; and the listener was led to hope that
if diligent, devout, and earnest, he would meet his friend in the
world of light, when all results of faithful labour will be
finally revealed.</p>
<p>On reviewing the appearance of the neighbourhood, compared
with what it was years before, changes were visible.&nbsp;
Kensington had enlarged, the population had increased; still
there were rural spaces between the Court suburb and the
neighbouring localities; and people from Paddington, from
Brompton, and from Knightsbridge took long country walks to their
chosen place of worship.&nbsp; Hence pastoral visitation required
much time and some toil; and many were the wanderings in unknown
neighbourhoods, taken by the new minister in order to secure an
acquaintance with his hearers.</p>
<p>The congregation had become large in the latter part of Dr.
Vaughan&rsquo;s time; and old families who had loved him did not
transfer, but rather extended their attachment to the object of
their recent choice.&nbsp; Without mentioning names, which would
be invidious, there was <i>here</i> an old gentleman who looked
well after his pastor&rsquo;s interests; <i>there</i> an old lady
with a large school, who did all she could to bring her pupils
under the spiritual influence of the preacher they heard from
week to week; <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>and <i>elsewhere</i> a family group outstretching
helpful hands for all sorts of good works.&nbsp; The kindness,
candour, and forbearance of all were wonderful; and if a few were
not reconciled at first to the change which had happened, and
naturally sighed at the loss they had sustained, they never
evinced alienation, but gradually came to listen lovingly to the
pulpit occupant, whom the Great Master, they believed, had sent
amongst them.&nbsp; Many new attendants gradually sought sittings
on the old spot; some of them long since entered a better world
and a better Church, and others still remain, who kindly greet
the retired shepherd whenever, happily for himself, he comes in
their way.</p>
<p>It may be mentioned that Kensington, on many accounts, has
long been a favourite place of residence for artists and literary
men, and a few of these became some occasional, others regular
hearers.&nbsp; Two Royal Academicians, and one of the editors of
<i>Punch</i>, will be remembered by some who read these pages;
and an eminent sculptor still remains faithful to his early
ecclesiastical attachment.&nbsp; In later days the present
President of the Institution of Civil Engineers <a
name="citation73"></a><a href="#footnote73"
class="citation">[73]</a> removed from the north to Kensington,
and fully won the confidence and affection of his pastor; others,
whom it would be boastful to mention, and some still spared for
great usefulness, lightened the load of his cares and increased
the sum of his enjoyments.</p>
<p><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>One
most interesting fact should not be passed over.&nbsp; Kensington
was remarkable for ladies&rsquo; boarding schools, and a number
of the pupils attended Hornton Street chapel.&nbsp; Thus the
pastor gathered round him a circle in which he took a very lively
interest.&nbsp; Friendships were then formed which have since
been the joy of his life; and in the evening of his days it is
his privilege to regard several of them still with a fatherly
affection, to which they faithfully respond.</p>
<p>Curious characters at different periods, it may be added would
come into the vestry to have a little chat; a gentleman during
the Crimean War gravely proposed to the preacher of peace a
clever scheme for blowing up Sebastopol; and at another time one
of clerical appearance repeated, with extraordinary rapidity,
long passages out of the Greek Testament.</p>
<p>Immediately after the commencement of the new pastorate,
important questions arose as to the administration of
ecclesiastical affairs&mdash;indeed, as to the proper
constitution of the Church.&nbsp; The narrative in this volume
has shown that the congregation at Hornton Street was originally
gathered by Presbyterians; and that though no definite form of
polity was adopted, the method of proceedings followed somewhat
the Presbyterian model.&nbsp; The institution of <i>elders</i>
was proposed, but not carried out; <i>managers</i>, whose office
seems to have resembled somewhat that of elders, were at once
appointed.&nbsp; For a long time they distinctly and frequently
appear in the records of the Society.&nbsp; Moreover, at first
mention is <a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>made of &ldquo;communicants,&rdquo;
&ldquo;members,&rdquo; and &ldquo;subscribers&rdquo;, but the
word &ldquo;Church&rdquo; occurs only now and then, until the
appellation became established in Dr. Leifchild&rsquo;s
time.&nbsp; &ldquo;Deacons,&rdquo; too, are mentioned, but not in
a way to indicate what were their distinct duties, and in what
manner they were chosen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Managers&rdquo; continued
to administer affairs all the way through; and such persons held
office down to the termination of Dr. Vaughan&rsquo;s
ministry.&nbsp; The practice, when he left, was strictly
congregational; but still the existence of
&ldquo;managers,&rdquo; in distinction from deacons, lingered
on,&mdash;the managers having chiefly to do with the collection
of subscriptions and the support of the minister.&nbsp; When the
new pastorate opened, it was thought time to put an end to what,
on Congregational principles, is an anomaly, and to reduce the
administrative power to the scriptural form of bishop and
deacons.&nbsp; Hence the office of manager was abolished, and an
election of new deacons followed.&nbsp; Those who had been called
&ldquo;managers&rdquo; were now elected to the diaconate, and new
men were added to the number.&nbsp; Altogether they now amounted
to seven; their names being Messrs. Newton, James, Hine, Walker,
Thurston, Tomlin, and Watson.&nbsp; To give additional importance
to this new step in the Church&rsquo;s history, it was thought
desirable to have special services connected with it; therefore,
first the pastor, at a special Church meeting, explained the
nature of the office, as given in the New Testament, and next Dr.
Tidman, at a week evening lecture, delivered an appropriate
address <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>to
the newly-chosen officers.&nbsp; The Church now, in form as well
as spirit, received a decidedly Congregational impress; and so it
has continued ever since.&nbsp; From time to time new diaconal
elections were held, as vacancies occurred; the ballot being
adopted, though the names of suitable persons could be mentioned
beforehand, the pastor and those already in office being allowed,
not indeed to <i>dictate</i>, but to <i>suggest</i> such as
seemed most qualified for the office.&nbsp; The last-mentioned
deacon on the list just given&mdash;Mr. Robert Watson, of
Hammersmith&mdash;ought to be specially noticed, for he wrought a
practical change in the conduct of Church business little
appreciated at the time.&nbsp; Being a most conscientious,
methodical, and business-like man, as well as a devout and
earnest Christian, he, as secretary of the official staff,
conducted everything in the most orderly manner.&nbsp; I have
heard him say that Church business occupied the chief time of one
of his clerks.&nbsp; The change he introduced into the minutes of
proceedings is very striking.&nbsp; Whereas before, entries were
vague and irregular, and no clue is afforded to determine when
and how members were admitted; after Mr. Watson took office,
Church meetings are reported from month to month, with the
greatest regularity; and it can be seen at once who were received
into communion, and what of a spiritual or secular kind
transpired.&nbsp; He and his brethren revised the list of members
every year, striking off with inexorable decision the names of
such as had ceased to attend the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.&nbsp; In
March, 1848, it was made <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>a standing rule, &ldquo;That any
member being absent from the Lord&rsquo;s Table for six
consecutive months without sufficient cause assigned, shall,
after notice to the party and mention to the Church, be
considered to have withdrawn from the communion of this
Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be added, that a distinction was made
between members in full communion&mdash;having a right to vote in
the choice of &ldquo;bishop and deacons,&rdquo; and on other
ecclesiastical questions&mdash;and persons only occasional
communicants, not adopting Nonconformist opinions, though from
spiritual sympathy wishing to unite with the Church at the
Lord&rsquo;s Table.&nbsp; Occasional communion often led the way
to complete fellowship; the communicant, however, had to be
elected at a Church meeting to a full share in ecclesiastical
rights and privileges.</p>
<p>It may be mentioned further that young people, before they
reached an age which would justify their giving a vote respecting
Church affairs, were allowed to partake of the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper, their subsequent full admission to fellowship depending
upon their election in the usual manner.&nbsp; That
&ldquo;manner&rdquo; was in accordance with the usual practice in
Congregational Churches half a century ago.&nbsp; A candidate
first had an interview with the pastor; then he or she was
proposed to the Church; one of the deacons <i>generally</i>, but
not <i>always</i>, had conversation with the individual; and at
the next Church meeting, after a report of eligibility, the
election followed by a show of hands. <a name="citation77"></a><a
href="#footnote77" class="citation">[77]</a></p>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>That
all particulars relating to the constitution of the Church may be
disposed of at once, it remains to be remarked, that when a new
trust deed of Church premises had to be made, instead of the
Assembly&rsquo;s Catechism being recognised as a standard of
belief, a short general statement of evangelical doctrines was
employed.</p>
<p>The year 1845 completed the first half century of the
Church&rsquo;s existence, and it was deemed fit that the jubilee
should be celebrated by a special service.&nbsp;
Accordingly,&rdquo; a commemorative discourse&rdquo; was
delivered on the 13th of April by the pastor, and it appeared in
print at the request of the congregation.&nbsp; Two passages may
be introduced:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With devout gratitude it should be
remembered that the past half century has been marked with
peace.&nbsp; While some Churches have been torn with intestine
strife, or wrecked by schisms, or reduced to a mere shadow by
heartless formality, the communion of the faithful in this place
has been a practical illustration of the Psalmist&rsquo;s words,
&lsquo;Behold! how good and pleasant a thing it is for brethren
to dwell together in unity;&rsquo; while at the same time they
have exemplified the principle that progress is the law of
spiritual existence in societies as well as in individuals.&nbsp;
It has not been the peacefulness of death, but the peacefulness
of life which has reigned over this spot; not the calmness of the
stagnant pool, but the smooth and gentle flow of living waters;
not the stillness of the rocky desert, where all is desolate and
bare and cold, but the silence of the garden and the grove, where
vitality gushes through many a channel, and proves its presence
and power by abundance of foliage, flowers, and fruit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every Church should be a kind of missionary station for
its whole vicinity, a centre of exertion and influence telling on
the surrounding sphere; a lighthouse built on a rock, lifting
aloft the <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>lamps of truth, warning, and invitation; or, rather, a
floating light moving in the person of its members through the
adjacent district, to illuminate the benighted, to guide the
wanderer, and to save the soul from moral shipwreck.&nbsp;
Happily, the obligation to exemplify an active Christianity is
now acknowledged by our Churches in general; and an apparatus
adapted to the evangelization of the bordering territory is held
to be essential to their completeness.&nbsp; We feel the
obligation ourselves, and, by the Divine blessing, we have much
of the religious machinery of the day at work upon this
spot.&nbsp; But still, does it not admit of question whether, as
the advocates of a system which boasts of its untrammelled
freedom of action, and its vigorous voluntary power; as those who
believe that our cause, to use the words of Dr. Doddridge, is
&lsquo;the cause of evangelical piety&rsquo;; as those,
especially, who profess to be under everlasting and infinite
obligation to Him from whom we have received our light and
salvation;&mdash;I repeat, does it not admit of question, whether
we are doing all that might be fairly expected of us, for the
diffusion of the truths we so much value throughout the
neighbourhood where we are located; whether our energies are put
forth to the full for the extension of the cause in a place which
numbers its 27,000 inhabitants, nearly four times the number of
the population fifty years ago, when this chapel was built;
whether we have provided all the means of Christian education we
might and ought, especially for those of our neighbours who are
lying around in vast masses, covered with the gloom of spiritual
ignorance, and paralysed, to an awful degree, by moral
insensibility?&nbsp; While there is much, very much, already
done, which should encourage our hearts and fill us with
gratitude, is there not much, very much, yet to be accomplished,
to which Providence seems most urgently to bid us put an earnest,
steady, persevering hand.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Important consequences resulted from these hints.&nbsp; In May
it was resolved, &ldquo;That a special meeting of the Church
should be convened, and that members should be informed that the
deacons have considered it desirable that certain alterations
should be made in order to provide increased
accommodation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such a meeting <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>was held, and
it determined that the chapel should be enlarged by throwing the
vestry and small schoolroom behind the pulpit wall, with the
organ gallery, into the body of the building, so that a
considerable number of additional sittings might be provided for
the enlarged congregation.&nbsp; Such an alteration was effected,
and the chapel was re-opened in October by Dr. Vaughan.</p>
<p>In connection with the chapel enlargement, additional
accommodation was provided at the back of the premises for the
British and Sunday schools.&nbsp; These alterations created an
impetus, happily felt by people and pastor.&nbsp; Various kinds
of work went on, two of which may be mentioned: first, the
delivery of a course of lectures in the new schoolroom on
&ldquo;Christian Evidences,&rdquo; which attracted large
audiences from week to week; and next, the institution of a Bible
class, including the whole of the week evening congregation, when
expositions of Scripture were given by the pastor, followed by a
list of questions.&nbsp; These questions were taken home, and the
week after written replies were brought.&nbsp; In many instances
the replies were of a very superior order, and the reading of the
papers excited a very deep interest.&nbsp; The exercise proved a
success, and the schoolroom was often crowded on these
occasions.</p>
<p>The chapel, enlarged in 1845, became in 1847 too small to
accommodate sufficiently the increased number of attendants, and
to meet the spiritual wants of the neighbourhood.&nbsp; A select
meeting in Hornton Street vestry speedily followed, to consider
what, under the <a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>circumstances, ought to be attempted, and the result was
a resolution to erect a new chapel at Bayswater, to which a
portion of the Kensington congregation living in the Bayswater
neighbourhood might remove. <a name="citation81"></a><a
href="#footnote81" class="citation">[81]</a>&nbsp; This measure
was advocated by the pastor as the right way of promoting the
interest of Evangelical Congregationalism.&nbsp; To wait till
bickerings arose, and diversions occurred in consequence, was
truly mischievous.&nbsp; To &ldquo;swarm&rdquo; like bees, a
goodly number removing to a new hive, that was a wise method,
which God would be sure to bless.&nbsp; Mr. Walker, who lived at
Bayswater, was anxious for a <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>chapel there, and before the little
party in the vestry separated, much more than &pound;1,000 was
promised.&nbsp; Soon the amount reached the sum of
&pound;1,700.&nbsp; A committee was formed for the fulfilment of
the enterprise.</p>
<p>The year 1848 is memorable in the history of Europe.&nbsp; It
will be remembered that just then the Continent shook with
political convulsions from end to end; and in the month of April
the inhabitants of London felt intense anxiety, owing to the
Chartist demonstration on Kennington Common.&nbsp; The Sunday
before that incident a considerable number of Hornton Street
hearers consisted of gentlemen just sworn in as special
constables; and the grave and earnest manner of all present was
increased by the Rev. William Walford, who preached on the
occasion, and referred to his own recollections of what took
place in England when, from week to week, it heard of the Paris
Reign of Terror.&nbsp; God, he said, had brought this country
through a more terrible excitement then, and would still be a
protector of those who trusted in Him.&nbsp; Thus amidst
political storms the foundation of Horbury Chapel was laid, even
as Hornton Street, more than half a century before, had been
built when England felt the throes of the French Revolution.</p>
<p>The corner-stone of Horbury Chapel was laid by Sir Culling
Eardley, August 30th, 1848.&nbsp; The new building was completed
and opened in September, 1849.&nbsp; The Sunday before a sermon
was preached at Kensington from the words, &ldquo;<i>We be
brethren</i>,&rdquo; and the spirit of those words was embodied
in all the proceedings which ensued.</p>
<p><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>About
one hundred seat-holders left Hornton Street for Horbury; and
about forty members, including two very influential deacons,
Messrs. Newton and Walker, resigned, and migrated to the new
settlement.&nbsp; They requested, in a letter dated October 29th,
1849, their dismissal in the following appropriate
terms:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We, the undersigned members of the above
communion, purposing to separate ourselves from it, in order to
form a Church at Horbury Chapel, Notting Hill, of the same faith
and order, affectionately request that the necessary dismissal
may be granted to us for the purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While recognising the tie which for various periods has
outwardly bound us together in Church fellowship,&mdash;we desire
ever to continue attached to each other in the bonds of the
Gospel, and would gratefully acknowledge the goodness of our
heavenly Father in having so long vouchsafed to the Church at
Hornton Street His presence and blessing&mdash;in supplying it
with a succession of faithful pastors, in honouring the preaching
of His Word by them, in creating a spirit of activity and desire
for usefulness on the part of so many of our fellow-members, and
in permitting love and union to prevail in our midst.&nbsp; We
pray that these blessings may long be continued to you, and be
realized by us in our new connection; that there may be speedily
sent to us a pastor, a man after God&rsquo;s own heart, who shall
preach the Gospel fully and freely, deacons who shall purchase to
themselves a good degree, and that we and our fellow-members,
individually, as well as in our associated character, may be
distinguished alike for our humility and piety, and for our
activity and devotedness to the cause of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is interesting here to remember that, whilst the chapel was
being built, the idea arose that the new and the old
congregations might remain united under a common pastorate of two
or three ministers, they interchanging pulpits with each other
from week to week, the <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>communicants in the two places at the
same time forming together one organic Church.&nbsp; This would
have been very gratifying to the Hornton Street pastor, and would
have coincided with his views of primitive municipal Churches;
but practical difficulties arose, and the scheme was
abandoned.&nbsp; In lieu of it, however, the communicants at
Kensington and Notting Hill resolved annually to partake of the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper together, a practice which has since been
continued with hallowed and pleasant results.</p>
<p>If 1848 was a year of storms, 1851, when the first English
Exhibition was opened, will ever be remembered as a year of
peace.&nbsp; It seemed as though the millennium had dawned.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No more wars now,&rdquo; thought many a sanguine spirit,
soon to be undeceived in this respect; but the tranquillity and
good-will amongst the hundreds of thousands who thronged to the
Crystal Palace are undeniable, and the effect of it on the
Kensington Independent congregation was manifest in crowded
attendances and in animated services, for which the artistic
wealth and the manifold associations of the great gathering
furnished the pastor with manifold illustrations.</p>
<p>The rising tide of the Church at Kensington did not ebb when
the Exhibition was over; and owing to this, in the year 1854, the
friends found it necessary to consider whether they ought not to
build a new and much larger place of worship for themselves and
their neighbours.&nbsp; Promised subscriptions speedily opened
the way to the execution of this enterprise; and in June, 1854,
the pastor <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>laid the first stone of the chapel in Allen
Street.&nbsp; The chapel was opened in May, 1855, when the Rev.
Thomas Binney preached in the morning, and the Hon. and Rev.
Baptist Noel in the evening.&nbsp; On the following Sunday the
opening services were continued, Dr. John Harris preaching in the
morning, and the pastor in the evening.&nbsp; The Rev. William
Brock closed the series on the following Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>The entire cost, including purchase of the land, was
&pound;8,748 9<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and the whole was paid for on
the last Sunday in January, 1860, when public collections reached
the amount of &pound;365 10<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>,&mdash;being
seven shillings more than was required.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1856 the Church lost one of its most active
deacons.&nbsp; Mr. Padgett (brother-in-law of the pastor), who
had been formerly a deacon at Trevor Chapel, Brompton, died
suddenly whilst travelling in Switzerland, and it became the
pastor&rsquo;s painful duty to preach the funeral sermon, just
after his own return from a continental tour.&nbsp; The text
selected was Amos v. 8: &ldquo;Seek Him that maketh the seven
stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the
morning, and, maketh the day dark with night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A season of great anxiety occurred in the month of January,
1857, when the pastor received an invitation from New College to
become Principal of that institution, upon the death of the
lamented Dr. Harris.&nbsp; The intimate connection between the
pastor and that college&mdash;he having taken an active part in
the foundation of it, <a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>and having declined one of the
professorships offered at that time&mdash;made him particularly
anxious to ascertain the path of duty at this crisis.&nbsp; He
informed the deacons of what had occurred, and sought their
advice.&nbsp; He wished to decide, not according to any
preconceived plan, but as it might appear on a comparison of
claims, arising from the college on the one hand, and the Church
on the other.&nbsp; The deacons returned the following
answer:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Having this evening met to consider the
important communication which you submitted to us last Tuesday,
in reference to the invitation given to you to succeed the late
Dr. Harris as Principal of New College, we have prayerfully, and
with thoughtful earnestness, endeavoured to view the matter in
all its bearings, and we thank you for the confidence implied in
the fact of your having referred the matter to us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although as deacons of the Church under your charge its
interests naturally present themselves prominently before us, we
have sought to avoid any selfish or contracted feelings in
reference to that Church, and have desired to take an enlarged
view of the interests of the Church of Christ as a whole.&nbsp;
Our first attention has been given to the suggestion made by you
as to the practicability of your retaining a limited connection
with Kensington Chapel as minister while undertaking the
principalship; and our feeling is that it could not be done with
comfort to yourself or advantage to the Church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In considering the matter generally, the following
points have occurred to us as deserving of serious
attention:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;1.&nbsp; The special claims of Kensington as a sphere
of labour for an intelligent Christian minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2.&nbsp; Your peculiar qualifications for representing
the interests of Nonconformity in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3.&nbsp; The peaceful and prosperous state of the
Church under your charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;4.&nbsp; The claims of a confiding and affectionate
people who, within the last two years, have manifested their
attachment by erecting our present place of worship at a cost of
several thousand pounds, of which a large amount still remains
due.</p>
<p><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>&ldquo;5.&nbsp; Your success as a preacher, and your
increasing acceptableness to your own people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;6.&nbsp; The more limited opportunity which would be
afforded to you at New College of exercising your talents as a
preacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;7.&nbsp; The difficulty which the Church anticipates in
securing an appropriate successor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;8.&nbsp; The fact that it would not be more difficult
(if as much so) to supply the vacant office than your vacant
pulpit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other considerations, which we need not enumerate, have
occurred to our minds.&nbsp; The foregoing we venture to submit
to your attention.&nbsp; They have led us to the conclusion that,
however honourable the invitation may be to you, and however it
may be pressed upon your notice, and however usefully you might
be employed in it, it does not appear to us to be your duty to
relinquish your present position and sphere, where you have been
so much blessed, in order to undertake the office in
question.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This letter decided the point.&nbsp; Attractive as was the
post at New College, the claims of the Church at Kensington,
especially so soon after the building of the new chapel, appeared
more urgent: and it may be added that the deacons, especially Mr.
Watson, turned the incident to account by proposing that
&pound;1,000 should be raised as a thank-offering for the
continuance of the existing pastorate, the sum to be employed in
liquidation of the chapel debt.&nbsp; This amount contributed to
its entire extinction.</p>
<p>Encouraging years of labour followed, and in 1860 additions to
the Church reached their highest point up to that time,&mdash;a
proof of the Divine blessing on what had been done and
determined; and it was regarded as a cause for special gratitude
and thanksgiving.</p>
<p>The new chapel was thoroughly repaired and embellished <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>in 1863, at a
cost of about &pound;600.&nbsp; Of this amount the sum of
&pound;400 was subscribed beforehand, and the rest was obtained
by collections on the last Sunday of January, 1864.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1865 the Church, long aware of their
pastor&rsquo;s wish to visit the Holy Land, most generously came
forward to gratify him in this respect, and opened a subscription
which amounted, almost immediately, to the sum of &pound;400,
which was placed at his disposal to defray the expenses of the
journey.&nbsp; A public meeting followed, when the money,
enclosed within a tastefully devised oriental-like purse, mounted
in gold, was presented, with an intimation that, during the
absence of about four months, the friends would undertake to pay
supplies.&nbsp; Before his departure he delivered two sermons on
the first Sunday in February, and on the 7th of the month started
with Dr. Allon, Dr. Spence, the Rev. John Bright, of Dorking, and
Mr. Stanley Kemp Welch, on the much talked of trip. <a
name="citation88"></a><a href="#footnote88"
class="citation">[88]</a>&nbsp; It proved successful and
gratifying, except that a serious illness befel Dr. Spence during
his journey, and that the Kensington pastor returned as yellow as
an old Indian, much to the dismay of his flock when they lovingly
welcomed him back to the pulpit.&nbsp; The temporary attack of
jaundice, however, proved not at all injurious, as after his
recovery from it his health was if anything better than
before.&nbsp; Certainly the journey gave him an interest in
Palestine, and in the <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>Scriptures relating to it, greater
than ever, and furnished ample materials for lectures to the
congregation.</p>
<p>The year after his return from the Holy Land he expressed a
wish, not only for his own sake, but the better to meet spiritual
wants in the Church and the surrounding district, that an
assistant should be provided; and this matter came before the
Church in February, 1866, when the following resolution was
passed: &ldquo;That this meeting desires to express its cordial
concurrence in the deacons&rsquo; proposal for the appointment of
an assistant to the minister, to be selected by him, and to be
sustained, as an experiment for one year, by a special
fund.&rdquo;&nbsp; In pursuance of this resolution the Rev. Alden
Davies became assistant minister, and proved so useful in
visitation, superintendence of classes, and preaching on Sunday
afternoons, and other occasions, that his services were prolonged
for three years, greatly to the comfort of his senior colleague,
and the satisfaction of his numerous friends.</p>
<p>Two important incidents occurred in 1868.&nbsp; The first was
the celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the
pastor&rsquo;s ministry at Kensington, when a large public
meeting was held in the month of October.&nbsp; The Rev. Thomas
Binney took the chair, and was surrounded by a numerous company
of London ministers.&nbsp; Numerous congratulatory speeches were
delivered, but that which alone needs particular notice was the
statement read by Mr. Shepheard, one of the deacons of the Church
who for many years had rendered most valuable and important
services.&nbsp; He stated that in 1843 there were 251 <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>members, and
that since 1843, 1,200 members had been added, the number on the
Church roll at the time the meeting was held being about 500; so,
he said, &ldquo;the Church has been doubled in number since our
pastor commenced his ministry amongst us.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
report appeared all the more gratifying when it was remembered
that in 1849 forty members had been dismissed to the new Church
at Horbury.&nbsp; He also read a long list of sums, amounting
altogether to &pound;32,821, contributed by the congregation
during twenty-five years, independently of the amount raised for
the support of the ministry, and for incidental expenses in
carrying on worship.&nbsp; Of the sum just mentioned, nearly
&pound;1,300 had been devoted to chapel and school building
purposes; nearly &pound;9,000 to missionary operations;
&pound;5,630 to the advancement of education; and &pound;5,480 to
relieving the poor.&nbsp; The other incident of this year 1868
was the laying of the first stone of the new schools in Allen
Street.</p>
<p>It had for a long time been felt desirable that enlarged
accommodation should be provided for the Sunday and Day
Schools.&nbsp; The buildings in Hornton Street had become too
small and altogether inconvenient.&nbsp; The Metropolitan Railway
Company in 1868 wanted to purchase the premises for their own
purposes, and this opportune circumstance enabled the friends to
accomplish their long-cherished desire.&nbsp; Part of the ground
in Allen Street purchased for the site of the chapel remained
unoccupied.&nbsp; A plan for erecting almshouses on it had been
suggested, but it failed though favoured <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>by several
friends.&nbsp; It was now available for schools, and consequently
became appropriated for that purpose.</p>
<p>It was at first intended that the laying of the first stone
should form part of the celebration just described, but
circumstances compelled a postponement of the ceremony; it was,
however, performed by the pastor soon afterwards.</p>
<p>When the twenty-eighth year of the existing pastorate arrived,
the pastor, having reached the sixty-fourth year of his age,
expressed to the Church an idea which he had cherished through
his whole ministerial life.&nbsp; The first few years after his
ordination he spent as a junior co-pastor, and his desire was,
should he reach old age, that the last few years should be spent
in service as a senior co-pastor.&nbsp; He thought at his age it
was time to contemplate such an arrangement.&nbsp; This, with
various considerations supporting his opinion, he submitted to
his people, entreating them to remember the subject in private
prayer.&nbsp; In the month of April, 1871, the Church resolved
&ldquo;that the time had arrived when provision should be made
for supplementing the minister&rsquo;s services by the
appointment of a co-pastor.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Rev. Chas. S.
Slater, of Nottingham, having preached at Kensington with much
acceptance, the Church, in the month of March, 1872, sent him a
cordial and unanimous invitation to become co-pastor; but he
stated that he felt obliged to decline it, whilst acknowledging
the receipt of it in highly becoming terms.&nbsp; The obligation
arose from the circumstance that his people at Nottingham were
engaged in the building of <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>schools, an enterprise to the
completion of which he stood pledged, and therefore he could not
leave in the midst of the undertaking.&nbsp; Disappointed in this
attempt, and discouraged by further inquiries, the pastor
informed the Church that &ldquo;as difficulties in securing a
co-pastor were found to be so great, it had been thought
desirable for the present to seek the services of an assistant
minister, and that the pastor would in the meantime avail himself
of student&rsquo;s help on Sunday evenings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plan of occasional help on Sunday evenings did not prove a
success.&nbsp; The evening congregation declined, and the need of
more pastoral work being done became increasingly visible.&nbsp;
Hence in October, 1872, at a special meeting of the Church, the
pastor expressed the feeling he had, that under existing
circumstances it would be most advantageous for the spiritual
interests of the people that the ground should be cleared for an
efficient successor, who could undertake the whole duty, and so
render the plan of assistanceship needless.&nbsp; This
communication, received in the kindest manner, evoked the
expression of a desire for a continuance of the existing
pastorate as long as possible.&nbsp; Numerous consultations and
interchanges of opinion followed, all carried on in a most
harmonious manner; the sequel was, the pastor yielded to
affectionate solicitations, and for the present deferred his
resignation.</p>
<p>In the month of December, 1872, an extraordinary service took
place.&nbsp; It was occasioned by the death of Sir Donald F.
Macleod, C.B., K.C., S.A., who had for <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>some time attended divine worship in
Allen Street and communed with the Church at the Lord&rsquo;s
Table.&nbsp; He died from a mysterious accident at the Kensington
High Street railway station, and this circumstance, together with
his distinguished character and rank, attracted a crowded
congregation when his funeral sermon was preached.&nbsp; A large
number of officers and civilians connected with India, including
Lord Lawrence, were present, and the greatest respect was shown
to his memory.&nbsp; The discourse was published by request, and
as this sketch of Kensington Church history is intended to
include notices of eminent members of the congregation, the
following extracts are not inappropriate:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Having honourably and successfully occupied
different posts of important service in India, he, in the year
1865, attained to the high position of Lieutenant-Governor of the
Punjaub. . . .&nbsp; Sir Donald had a rare gift for putting
himself into kindly fellowship with those he ruled, whether rich
or poor, entering into their feelings and cultivating their
regards, and by degrees he acquired a widespread influence in
what might be called the country of his adoption, and all loved
him as a friend and father; and it has been said, if the natives
in the Punjaub had had to choose a prince, it would have been Sir
Donald; a still more striking remark, given in the notice of his
life by a leading journal, was recently made by a native
gentleman, to the effect that &lsquo;If all Christians were like
Sir Donald Macleod, there would be no Mahomedans or
Hindoos.&rsquo; . . .&nbsp; His calmness and self-possession
during the fearful crisis of 1857 made him a safe counsellor when
others were unnerved; besides which, on another occasion, during
a terrible outbreak of cholera, he exerted himself in the care of
sufferers, and in the burial of the dead, whilst others,
panic-stricken, rushed away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had an extraordinary power of making friends, and
few have had so large a circle of friendship.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Wherever he went,&rsquo; remarks a relative, &lsquo;his
presence was like sunshine, and the sunshine <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>was the
reflection of another presence, even of Him of whom it is said,
&ldquo;In Thy presence is fulness of joy.&rsquo;&rdquo; . .
.&nbsp; His bright, cheerful appearance, commanding figure, and
pleasant utterances won all hearts, especially those of the
young, who were attracted by the magic of sympathy, a rare gift,
which he did not fail rightly to employ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Into Thine hand I commit my spirit; Thou hast redeemed
me, O Lord God of truth,&rdquo; were amongst the last words he
uttered, and they were selected as the text for his funeral
sermon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the winter of 1872 the pastor felt it necessary to change
his residence, when the ladies of the congregation raised a
purse, which, with the addition of &pound;100 from one friend,
amounted to between &pound;300 and &pound;400.&nbsp; This
bountiful gift, conveyed privately by one of the contributors,
touched his heart as may be supposed, and made him feel how great
was his people&rsquo;s generosity, and how gracefully they
exercised it.&nbsp; The avoidance of publicity, and the delicate
mode of conveying the present, increased greatly his sense of
obligation, and attached him to so noble-minded a people more
strongly than ever.&nbsp; Their interest in the future he
resolved more than ever to consider.</p>
<p>The autumn of that year he visited America, being invited,
with the Rev. Joshua C. Harrison, &ldquo;the friend of his
life,&rdquo; to attend the Evangelical Conference at New
York.&nbsp; This was most refreshing, and in renewed health and
spirits he returned, in November, to his beloved people; the
chapel during his absence having been restored, painted, and
decorated anew.</p>
<p>Harmony and love continued, but the want of additional <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>assistance
still pressed on all sides.&nbsp; The services of the Rev. S.
Matthews, now pastor at Southampton, were secured for one year,
and he co-operated with the senior minister very pleasantly;
other help was also obtained, but at length the inevitable hour
arrived.&nbsp; The Church received the following communication
from their pastor in November, 1874:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Beloved
Flock</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is now two years since I made an important
communication touching our relationship to one another.&nbsp; I
then stated, that upon a review of our affairs it struck me that
there were subjects for mutual congratulation and for devout
gratitude, particularly in the cheering aspect of the morning
congregation and in your generous responses to benevolent
appeals; but, at the same time, that there were other things of a
different character which weighed upon my mind, such as the state
of attendance on Sunday and week evenings, the need of more
pastoral activity, to which growing years, personal habits, and
increasing claims outside the Church tended to disqualify me,
increasingly in proportion to the lapse of time.&nbsp; What was
needed I pointed out as consisting of an infusion of fresh and
youthful blood, with a more comprehensive, steady, and systematic
control of our Institutions: wants only to be supplied by a new,
vigorous, faithful, and exemplary minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I then ventured to touch upon difficulties, ascertained
through experience, in the way of obtaining either an assistant
or a co-pastor who would secure the confidence, sympathy, and
support of the Church at large.&nbsp; Nor did I omit to notice a
question long pressing on my mind, as to whether it was worth
your while to incur increased pecuniary obligations for the sake
of retaining services which, in the course of nature, could not
be continued for many years longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My judgment, I said, pointed in the direction of
retirement, and I urged upon you the consideration that, on the
whole, it might be easier, wiser, and better, at once, or very
soon, to seek a new pastor altogether, than to aim at mere
assistance or even a full co-pastorate.&nbsp; I also suggested
that, perhaps, with my confirmed habits and tastes, <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>I might serve
the Divine Master more usefully in some other way, than by
continuing to hold the office of a settled pastor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I intimated distinctly what a sore trial it was to me
to make such a communication; with what deep sorrow I should
separate from a people whom I had watched and loved for so many
years, not, I hope, without some considerable success; and that I
was prompted in what I said, not by desires for personal
gratification, or by love of ease, or a preference for literary
pursuits, but <i>simply and entirely</i> by a sense of duty and a
<i>supreme desire</i>, to promote the welfare of the Church at
Kensington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My communication was very kindly considered by the
deacons and yourselves, and at length I received a resolution
affectionately entreating me to retain the pastorate without any
stipulation as to time, and generously offering to provide an
assistant.&nbsp; I complied with your request, so far as to say
that without pledging myself to a permanent retention of office,
I would accept your liberal offer to provide assistance, and
would for the present continue my labours amongst you.&nbsp; A
little more than a year afterwards, on my return from America,
you invited for the term of twelve months my friend and brother,
the Rev. S. G. Matthews, who has co-operated with me in the most
harmonious and affectionate manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His term of service will presently expire, and now that
two years have elapsed since I made my communication&mdash;a
period which you will remember I then specified&mdash;the whole
subject returns on my mind with increasing force.&nbsp; Before I
left home for the holidays, I stated as much to the deacons; and
what I then thought and felt has been deepened by the effect of
my recent great domestic sorrow, with respect to which many of
you have expressed the tenderest sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more I reflect on the matter, the more I am
confirmed in my former judgment&mdash;that, looking at my time of
life, and at growing infirmities, which though they may not
affect my pulpit labours, do affect my pastoral influence, and
moreover, looking at pecuniary and other questions,&mdash;an
entire change in the pastoral administration of affairs at
Kensington seems desirable for the Church and congregation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most reluctantly, with much pain, and at the cost of
considerable self-sacrifice in more than one way, I reach the
conclusion that our long and happy relationship must come to an
end.&nbsp; Therefore I beg <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>now to place my resignation in your
hands, and to propose, with the view of relieving you from
prolonged suspense and uncertainty, that it should take effect at
Lady-day next, when I shall make way for a successor who will, I
trust, under God&rsquo;s blessing, perpetuate and advance the
work which it has been my honour to carry on more than thirty-one
years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think I shall be charged with vanity if I add
that I am persuaded this communication will give pain.&nbsp;
Attachment has been so often expressed, the affection of many has
been so strongly and practically shown, that it would be
unreasonable and ungrateful to suspect I did not still enjoy your
confidence and love.&nbsp; I am assured of both, and my hope is
that though my pastoral relationship will cease, our mutual
friendship will continue, and that in future days I may have
opportunities of continued intercourse and occasional
service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Church at Kensington will have a large and warm
place in my heart as long as that heart beats in this world; and
my prayer is, that in the world to come we may all enjoy life and
fellowship everlasting.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An anxious discussion followed the reading of this letter at a
Church meeting, held on the 12th of November, when the members
recorded &ldquo;the deep regret with which they had received from
their beloved pastor the communication now presented by the
deacons&rdquo;; also their full appreciation of &ldquo;the
motives and reasons which had led him to his decision&rdquo;; the
&ldquo;unabated attachment&rdquo; which they still cherished
towards him; and their gratitude to God &ldquo;for the peace
which had prevailed in the Church,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;many
mercies vouchsafed&rdquo; both to pastor and people.</p>
<p>A committee was formed to consider what further steps should
be taken, and the meeting came &ldquo;with the utmost regret and
reluctance to the conclusion that the only course now open was to
accept the resignation of <a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>their beloved and honoured
pastor.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the committee gave in their report,
some members lovingly made further efforts to retain their old
minister, but others equally loving saw that such efforts would
be unavailing.&nbsp; At length all beautifully united in saying,
&ldquo;The will of the Lord be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was then resolved &ldquo;that this meeting considers
advantage should be taken of the opportunity afforded by the
resignation of Dr. Stoughton, for the members of the Church and
congregation . . . as well as for attached friends generally, to
express their esteem for Dr. Stoughton, and appreciation of his
character and valuable services in the cause of evangelical
truth, by a substantial presentation to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the resignation had been sent in and accepted, a sermon
was preached reviewing the past, explaining the present, and
anticipating the future:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is over forty years ago [said the
preacher] that there lived in the town of Windsor a venerable man
of God, who in early life had enjoyed only scanty educational
advantages, but who, with strong common sense and industrious
application to the study of Scripture and other reading, fitted
himself, under God&rsquo;s blessing, for the work of the
ministry, and well fulfilled his course.&nbsp; He lived as he
preached.&nbsp; He was a moral and spiritual power amongst his
neighbours.&nbsp; From the king on the throne to the humblest
inhabitant he was held in respect.&nbsp; George III. would speak
to some of his servants, who attended the ministry of this
excellent person, in terms of gracious approval.&nbsp; When years
advanced and infirmities increased, he set his heart upon having
a colleague, and after the congregation had listened to several
students from Highbury College, they fixed on a stripling, who
won the heart and warmly reciprocated the affection of the aged
prophet.&nbsp; As a son with a <a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>father, the young man served in the
gospel for about seven happy years, rejoicing in the honour paid
to the elder, in whose hoary hairs he gladly recognised a crown
of glory, because the wearer walked in the ways of
righteousness.&nbsp; Many of you will recognise at once who was
that aged saint, and I need hardly tell any here who was that
inexperienced but attached young man.&nbsp; After I came here it
was long a cherished dream, that if I should live to be an old
man, I might enter once more upon a co-pastorate.&nbsp; The sunny
memories I had and have of that relationship fostered
corresponding hopes, and seven years ago I began to pray for and
desire some one who might be associated with me in the ministry,
and grow into your affection and confidence, and at length
succeed me within these walls.&nbsp; Many and many a time have I
pondered the text of this morning, and imagined how I might
preach from it when the wished-for coming man should be
appointed.&nbsp; I used to think of what would be fitting on such
an occasion.&nbsp; &lsquo;He must increase, and I must
decrease,&rsquo; I said over and over again to myself, and not
without fear that poor human nature might, under the
circumstances, prove troublesome and rebellious.&nbsp; I
endeavoured to prepare for the hoped-for crisis by meditations
such as I have expressed in your hearing to-day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now I preach from the words without knowing who it
is that the Master destines to occupy in future years the pulpit
of this place.&nbsp; Who shall hereafter &lsquo;increase&rsquo; I
cannot tell.&nbsp; I only know who must
&lsquo;decrease.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not renounce the idea of a co-pastorate until I
was convinced from experience and observation that such a
co-pastorate as I desired was impracticable.&nbsp; I remember
often saying that I thought it must be an old man&rsquo;s fault
if he could not find, and work with, a fitting colleague.&nbsp;
Alas, the finding has proved an impossibility, though I still
incline to my old opinion of the working of the arrangement, when
an appropriate colleague can be found.&nbsp; I am still persuaded
that both for young ministers and for old ones the colligate plan
is very desirable.&nbsp; Age tempers youth.&nbsp; Youth animates
age.&nbsp; The senior with refined experience, the junior with
the flush and fervour of opening life, conjoined in pastoral
work, must surely to all appear a beautiful ideal.&nbsp; I was
not brought to say, &lsquo;What I shall <i>choose</i> I wot
not,&rsquo; but I have been compelled to forego the exercise of
<i>choice</i> in the matter, and to fall back on <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>simple
convictions of duty.&nbsp; Perhaps there is something amiss in
the working of our system in relation to colligate
ministries.&nbsp; Neither assistantships nor co-pastorates are in
favour now-a-days, though in earlier Nonconformist societies they
were.&nbsp; One minister is expected and desired to do
everything, and, in a sense not intended by Ignatius, his motto
finds a practical currency amongst us&mdash;widely as we may be
separated from him in notions of episcopal
government&mdash;&lsquo;nothing without the
bishop.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the 4th of April, 1875, Dr. Stoughton preached his farewell
sermon as pastor at Kensington.&nbsp; The text was 1
Thessalonians ii. 19, 20: &ldquo;For what is our hope, or joy, or
crown of rejoicing?&nbsp; Are not even ye in the presence of our
Lord Jesus Christ at His coming?&nbsp; For ye are our glory and
joy.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sermon concluded with these
words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Perhaps the strongest of all ministerial
power is sympathy in sorrow.&nbsp; It has been my lot to visit
many in affliction, to sit by many sick beds, to witness the
desolation of many a hearth, to grasp the widow&rsquo;s hand, to
kiss the orphan&rsquo;s cheek.&nbsp; If I have ever shed one drop
of healing balm over a wounded heart, or cast one ray of light
over a darkened dwelling, I thank God for it, as the fulfilment
of a ministry in which angels might have been glad to share; and
sure I am that the remembrance of it, and the prospect of
spending eternity together with the sons and daughters of sorrow
in that world where tears are wiped from off all faces, will form
no small part of my joy and crown of rejoicing in the presence of
the Lord Jesus Christ at His corning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, in the words of Edward Irving, let me say,
&lsquo;Brethren, I thank you in fine for the patience with which
you have heard me on this and all other occasions.&nbsp; I have
nothing to boast of, as St. Paul had when he parted with the
Ephesian elders.&nbsp; I can speak of your kindness and of the
Almighty&rsquo;s grace, but of my own performances I cannot
speak.&nbsp; Imperfections beset me round, which it is not my
part to confess, save to the God of mercy.&nbsp; All these
imperfections I crave you to forget.&nbsp; Fain would I continue
to have <a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>a place in your esteem and love, as you have in mine;
and besides this I have no favour to ask.&nbsp; Your kind
remembrance and prayer, that is all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And now, God grant that while the roof-tree of
this temple stands, and these walls resist the hand of
all-consuming time, there may be no voice uttered from this
pulpit but the voice of the Gospel of peace; that all who come up
to worship here may be accepted of the Lord; and that we who have
met so oft together, and joined the voice of our prayer and the
notes of our praise together, may yet lift the voice of our
prayer from beneath the altar of the living God, and minister our
praise around His holy throne.&nbsp; Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To each one I say, &lsquo;the Lord bless thee, and keep
thee: the Lord make His face to shine upon thee, and be gracious
unto thee; the Lord lift up His countenance upon thee, and give
thee peace.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the following Thursday evening a crowded meeting took place
in Kensington Chapel, Samuel Morley, Esq., M.P., in the
chair.&nbsp; Amongst those present were Sir Thomas Chambers,
M.P.; Mr. Henry Richard, M.P.; Sir Charles Reed; Dean Stanley;
Canon Freemantle; the Rev. J. P. Gell, Vicar of St. John&rsquo;s,
Notting Hill; the Rev. S. Minton; Dr. Morley Punshon; Dr. Angus;
Dr. Allon; Principal Newth; the Rev. J. C. Harrison; the Rev.
Baldwin Brown; and many other honoured brethren.</p>
<p>After addresses by the Rev. J. C. Harrison, the Rev. Samuel
Bergne (intimate personal friends of the retiring minister), the
Dean of Westminster, Sir Charles Reed, and the Rev. J. P. Gell,
Incumbent of St. John&rsquo;s,&mdash;Mr. Robert Freeman, an
active and honoured deacon of the Church for many years, read an
address in felicitous and graceful as well as truly Christian
language, and then placed in the retiring pastor&rsquo;s hands a
purse containing &pound;3,000.&nbsp; The whole assembly rose, and
afterwards <a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>Dr. Stoughton spoke at considerable length, and in
conclusion observed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As I leave you to-night, I think of Gregory
Nazianzan, when he took leave, one by one, of various familiar
objects in his beloved church at Constantinople.&nbsp; I could
speak to <i>that pulpit</i> from which I have often addressed
you, and that communion table round which we have gathered in
remembrance of the risen Saviour.&nbsp; I could pensively bid
them, one by one, farewell, though I fully hope often to visit
you again.&nbsp; I cannot forget Sunday mornings, when I have
seen loving smiles and looks responding to my utterances, and I
trust felt the presence of the Master so as to get very near to
heaven.&nbsp; I shall carry these memories with me into the world
of light and love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One word as to my position in reference to my
theological and ecclesiastical opinions.&nbsp; There are
different phases of Christian truth: the moral brought out by the
Apostle James, the doctrinal by the Apostle Paul, the
experimental by the Apostle Peter.&nbsp; One apostle above others
blended these peculiarities in himself, harmonizing them all,
like prismatic rays in &lsquo;candid light,&rsquo; to use Bishop
Warburton&rsquo;s expression&mdash;the &lsquo;candid,&rsquo;
pure, perfect light of Divine love.&nbsp; I have striven to make
him my model, to neglect no side of evangelical truth, but to go
all round it; and if my poor teaching under such guidance has
done any good, let God have all the praise.&nbsp; As to my
ecclesiastical position, I have never shrank from expressing my
opinion with regard to the Establishment principle.&nbsp; I am a
thorough and earnest Nonconformist.&nbsp; There are many reasons
why I could not conform; and I will now only mention this, that I
could not surrender my liberty to preach the gospel in the
pulpits of other communions, and to invite brethren of other
communions to preach in mine.&nbsp; I have not seen it my
vocation to join in certain movements of the day under the
guidance of those whose practical application of Nonconformist
principles in some respects differs from my own.&nbsp; I am not
finding fault with them, and I hope they will not find fault with
me.&nbsp; Let us agree to differ.&nbsp; One great object of my
life has been rather to improve our own denomination, than to
criticise and censure others; and also to cultivate loving
relationship with other Churches, and it is my peculiar joy that
my life aim in this respect has been generously recognised and
reciprocated.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>Speeches were then delivered by Dr. Punshon, Sir Thomas
Chambers, Dr. Angus, Mr. Richard (Dr. Stoughton&rsquo;s
fellow-student), the Rev. Guinness Rogers, and Mr. Henry
Wright,&mdash;a friend who had become deacon of the Church during
Dr. Stoughton&rsquo;s ministry, and had been especially active in
connection with the testimonial.&nbsp; Some playful allusions
were made in the course of the evening.&nbsp; One was by the
Dean, who said it was a custom amongst the monks at Westminster
to call a brother who had been amongst them thirty years by the
gentle name of <i>playfellow</i>, and never to do anything
disagreeable in his presence.&nbsp; And such, he would say, was
the tranquil period which their friend had reached, yet not so as
to quench hope of his still using voice and pen for the good of
others.&nbsp; Another was by Mr. Richard, who referred to a
debate in college days, between him and Dr. Stoughton, on the
question, &ldquo;Who was the greater man, Oliver Cromwell or
Napoleon Bonaparte?&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Stoughton took Cromwell, and
he, Mr. Richard, now the great political apostle of peace, then
preferred Napoleon.&nbsp; He supposed his friend remained true to
his idol, he himself had changed his standard of idolism.&nbsp;
The Hon. and Rev. Canon Freemantle pronounced the
benediction.</p>
<p>The address, elegantly illuminated and cased in morocco and
silver, was afterwards transmitted to Ealing, and the names of
contributors were read with much interest and gratitude.&nbsp;
Amongst them were those of rich and poor members of the
communion, and of distinguished <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>persons outside the Kensington
Church, including noblemen and dignitaries of the
Establishment.&nbsp; Mention ought to be made of Archdeacon
Sinclair, Vicar of the parish.&nbsp; He entered on that office
about the time that Dr. Stoughton came to Kensington.&nbsp; The
Vicar then called on him, to give a cordial welcome, and they
remained on terms of friendship down to the farewell
meeting.&nbsp; The congregation some time before sent a
contribution towards building the new parish church, of about
&pound;100, through their pastor&rsquo;s hands to the Vicar, who
expressed the greatest delight in accepting such a pledge of
Christian catholicity.&nbsp; After the farewell meeting, he wrote
saying that he hoped soon to call upon his old friend in his new
abode.&nbsp; But he died within a few weeks of the meeting, and
the first time Dr. Stoughton occupied the pulpit at Allen Street
Chapel after his retirement, was to preach a funeral sermon for
his beloved and honoured neighbour.</p>
<h2><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>VI.&nbsp; THE SIXTH PASTORATE.<br />
<i>THE REV. ALEXANDER RALEIGH</i>, <i>D.D.</i><br />
1875&ndash;1880.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">No</span> sooner had the vacancy occurred
than the Church&rsquo;s attention was directed to the Rev. G. S.
Barrett, of Norwich, who had eminent qualifications for the
Kensington pastorate.&nbsp; He was invited to preach before the
end of April, and immediately after he had done so, steps were
taken for calling the Church together.&nbsp; On the 13th of May a
meeting followed, when it was resolved to invite Mr. Barrett to
succeed Dr. Stoughton.&nbsp; The invitation was conveyed in the
form of unanimous and cordial resolutions, to which Mr. Barrett
replied before the end of the month, saying that if he felt it
would be right to leave Norwich, Kensington would be an
attractive sphere; but that after much consideration and prayer
it appeared to him a duty to remain where he was.</p>
<p>The door being closed in that quarter, the deacons and the
committee appointed to assist them turned their thoughts to the
Rev. Dr. Raleigh, whom they were given to understand &ldquo;might
not be unwilling to remove from <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>his present pastorate at Canonbury
to that of Kensington.&rdquo;&nbsp; The idea of securing so
eminent a man animated all who became acquainted with it; and
previously to laying this matter before the Church, the deacons
and committee communicated with Dr. Raleigh.&nbsp; Delicacy and
caution marked the communications on both sides, and the result
was, that on hearing a report of the circumstances, the Church in
August cordially invited Dr. Raleigh to accept the
pastorate.&nbsp; Again the invitation was conveyed in the form of
resolutions, and before the end of the month Dr. Raleigh returned
his answer:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The resolutions which were passed
unanimously at your meeting of the 5th of August, were presented
to me on the following morning by your deacons, who also gave me
in the frankest manner every explanation I could desire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those resolutions constitute a call to take the
pastoral oversight of you in the Lord.&nbsp; I have had this your
desire and invitation very much in my thought since I received
the intimation of them.&nbsp; I have had consultation with good
men, whose judgment in the case is dispassionate and impartial,
and I need not say that I have been asking God to &lsquo;send
forth His light and truth&rsquo; to make my way of duty
plain.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I cannot say that the path of duty has
been very easily found.&nbsp; The circumstances have been
peculiar.&nbsp; The claims of the two congregations to whom it
has for years been my privilege to minister have proved to be
unexpectedly strong, and the mutual trial of affection in the
thought of parting has been sometimes almost more than I could
resist.&nbsp; Yet steadily, if slowly, the guiding light of
God&rsquo;s good providence has seemed to lead westwards.&nbsp;
The reasons which made it possible for me to entertain the
proposal from the time when it was mentioned to me have
continued, as I knew they would do, and now, without specifying
them particularly, it is my duty to announce to you the result to
which they have led me; which is this, that I cordially accept
your cordial call, and will endeavour in Divine strength to
discharge, to the best <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>of my ability, the duties of the
sacred office to which I am thus called.&nbsp; May He who has
watched over your interests as a Christian Church for many years,
supplying you in successive pastorates with rich ministerial gift
and grace, and who has also blessed my humble ministry thus far,
make us blessings to each other, and in our associated capacity,
to many around us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cordially appreciate the mention of the name of Dr.
Stoughton, lately your pastor, and long my friend.&nbsp; I do not
lay claim to his many and high accomplishments as a scholar and a
theologian; but I believe I agree with him pretty closely in
doctrinal sentiment, in holding firmly &lsquo;the faith once
delivered to the saints,&rsquo; and in cherishing a generous and
charitable temper towards all who love our Lord Jesus Christ in
sincerity; and I must now make it my endeavour to emulate his
practical care and zeal on your behalf in all faithfulness,
diligence, watchfulness, and prayer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were only beginning the Christian ministry, I
might think it necessary and appropriate to say something of the
motives with which I undertake it, and of the spirit in which it
ought to be conducted.&nbsp; But having been now for many years
in the heat of the great strife, I must allow those years of toil
now past to speak for me concerning what will be (&lsquo;if the
Lord will&rsquo;) the aims and labours of the future.&nbsp; May
the blessing which has never been withheld from my humble
ministry, attend it still, and through your prayers and
co-operation be even more abundant than heretofore.&nbsp; The
grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.&nbsp;
Amen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A public recognition of the new pastor took place in Allen
Street in the month of November, when Dr. Stoughton presided, and
Dr. Allon, Dr. Punshon, Dr. Edmond, the Revs. J. C. Harrison, H.
Simon, and W. Roberts, took part in the service.</p>
<p>Dr. Stoughton congratulated the Church on having such a pastor
as they met to recognise, and the new pastor on having such a
Church as was now assembled.&nbsp; He could testify that Dr.
Raleigh would find at Kensington <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>a united and peaceful Church, a
people bound together by mutual affection, trained to work and
accustomed to work, people who would never give their pastor any
occasion for uneasiness, who would always respond to his appeal
and co-operate with him in his work.</p>
<p>Mr. H. Wright laid a full statement before the congregation of
circumstances which led to the proceedings of that evening, after
which the chairman said, when the President of the Wesleyan
Conference made way for his successor, he did so by handing over
the seals of office.&nbsp; He had nothing of that sort to offer
now, but if Dr. Raleigh would accept his predecessor&rsquo;s
hand, there it was, not empty, but with a heart in it.&nbsp; Dr.
Raleigh delivered an appropriate address.&nbsp; Dr. Punshon, Mr.
Harrison, Dr. Edmond, and Mr. Simon followed, expressing their
affection for the new pastor and his flock.</p>
<p>An election of new deacons had repeatedly occurred under the
former pastorate; and in the first year of the new administration
vacancies had to be filled up by ballot.&nbsp; The choice of the
members fell on Messrs. Cozens-Hardy, Plater, Spicer, Fordham,
White, and Watson,&mdash;the last being son of the late senior
deacon, whose death just before Dr. Stoughton&rsquo;s retirement
was a heavy loss, deeply lamented by his old friend and by the
Church at large.&nbsp; Messrs. Fordham, Cozens-Hardy, and George
White declined the office, from inability to give time for its
duties.&nbsp; The rest accepted the Church&rsquo;s request.&nbsp;
True to the sympathy and love so often expressed, <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>the friends
at Kensington were mindful of the retired minister when he lost
his beloved wife, and the following entry occurs in the Church
Book:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On Sunday morning, 23rd November, 1879, a
solemn memorial service was conducted by the pastor, Rev. A.
Raleigh, D.D., suggested by the death of Mrs. Stoughton, on the
11th of November, at Ealing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sermon was based on the passage (2 Cor. v. 9):
&lsquo;Willing rather to be absent from the body and to be
present with the Lord,&rsquo; Dr. Stoughton and his family being
among the worshippers.&nbsp; The Church wish, moreover, to record
their deep sympathy with Dr. Stoughton, in his sad bereavement,
and cherish the memory of Mrs. Stoughton as one who, during her
husband&rsquo;s long pastorate of thirty-two years at Kensington
Chapel, co-operated with him in all his work for the heavenly
Master, and endeared herself to many as a bright example to the
flock.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I shall be pardoned for the insertion of a single paragraph
from the beautiful sermon delivered by Dr. Raleigh on that
affecting occasion.&nbsp; It is no less true than
beautiful:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Fitted by education and culture for any
place in social life, it might have been thought by some that she
would be among the foremost always in visible activities and good
works.&nbsp; She was indeed always active, and was always engaged
in doing good; but always as much as possible in silent and
unseen ways.&nbsp; She was not one who could say, in view of the
many things that might be done by one in her position, of a more
or less public kind, &lsquo;therefore being always
confident.&rsquo;&nbsp; Rather she loved and sought the shade; if
a sweet and calm and all-helpful domestic life may be called the
shade, to a lady of deep piety and high culture.&nbsp; She strove
to make home good and happy, and succeeded; every child following
father and mother in Divine ways, and into the Church of God; and
then she strove to extend the blessedness to as many other homes
as possible.&nbsp; I know not that we could have a much <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>nobler
ideal and pattern of a woman&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; I have it on the
best authority, that of a ministerial friend who was like a
brother in the house, that many and many a poor minister&rsquo;s
home in the country was made warmer and brighter, and more what
home ought to be, by her generous persistence of care for them,
and by the gentle importunity of her letters to others on their
behalf.&nbsp; Her power of letter-writing was unique; all who
were privileged to receive these letters, on any subject, but
especially on Divine and spiritual subjects, felt the charm, and
valued the more the friendship of one who could write so for God
and for men.&nbsp; Her last years were weighted with deepening
affliction; yet were they calm and peaceful years to the
last.&nbsp; For months she waited on the border land, looking
heavenwards, thinking often no doubt of the loved ones who had
gone before, and who, as I have been told by one who well knows,
often seemed very near to her.&nbsp; The few who saw her felt
that they had been nearer heaven by only looking on her face and
listening to the few words she might say.&nbsp; These words were
words of thankfulness for all past mercies, of humble but firm
faith in the Saviour, and of calm, confident hope as to the
future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These words were found afterwards in her own
handwriting:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father, take my hand; quickly and straight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lead to heaven&rsquo;s gate Thy
child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quickly and straight,&rsquo; even as she desired, the
gate was opened; and the Father&rsquo;s child went in, went
home.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With regard to Dr. Raleigh&rsquo;s ministry at Kensington, I
cannot do better than quote the following words of his beloved
wife:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is little to record of the years at
Kensington.&nbsp; Like those of his first ministry at Rotherham,
they flowed evenly and sweetly; but many hearts hold them as a
sacred memory, and to himself they were years of much
happiness.&nbsp; He was able to work with vigour, and his people
came around him with growing affection.&nbsp; To none was his
ministry more dear than to those engaged in direct Christian
work.&nbsp; He clasped hands with them as fellow-workers; the
fervour of his zeal kindled theirs, and as he spoke of <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>the great
harvest to come, earthly honours seemed to grow poor compared
with the honour of bearing and sowing the precious seed of
God.&nbsp; &lsquo;By kindness, by love unfeigned,&rsquo; he won
his way to the affections of his people.&nbsp; And he gave them
as he had promised, &lsquo;good work,&rsquo; work which cost him
laborious days, and to which he brought all the treasures of his
long experience.&nbsp; His sermons were less ornate, perhaps,
than those of an earlier time, but they were more definite in
aim, more unencumbered in utterance, as if knowing that his time
was short, he had laid &lsquo;aside every weight,&rsquo; that the
simple truth might have free course.&nbsp; His teaching began to
be regarded with quick appreciation, and some of his hearers, men
in busy life, acknowledged that &lsquo;the whole week was
different and better because of the thoughts with which it was
begun.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;These Sundays at Kensington,&rsquo; writes one
of his people, &lsquo;were times of refreshment from the presence
of the Lord.&nbsp; The sound of his fervid utterances of heavenly
truth seem still to linger on the ear.&nbsp; We bless God that He
sent him to us, and for all the messages of love He enabled him
to declare, and for the glimpses of heaven he seemed to open to
our sight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throughout his teaching and in his own heart, the
mystic attraction of heaven was always strong.&nbsp; But
especially was this a very pronounced feature of his latest
ministry.&nbsp; He hardly preached a sermon in which he did not
lift up his eyes to the &lsquo;everlasting hills.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a blessed thing that sin has never effaced the
deep home-longings of human hearts, and no words were more
welcome than those in which he told of that world, &lsquo;where
prayer is answered, and toil is recompensed, and love claims her
own.&rsquo;&nbsp; Or of &lsquo;the open pathway, stretching
upward and afar, for home-going saints and holy
angels.&rsquo;&nbsp; Or of &lsquo;the banquet&rsquo; where,
&lsquo;in its earthly beginning we may wet our bread with tears
as we eat it, but whence we shall go to the higher and better,
God has in reserve, as we pass along to meet all the good of
every age, and to see Him in His glory at the banquet, and in the
fellowship of heaven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had himself got to the heavenward side of
life.&nbsp; He was as busy as he had ever been, entering fully
into the work, thinking and planning about it, as if he were
still young, and life all before him, and his interest in public
and passing events continued unquenched.&nbsp; Yet, and this is
no fancy, a deep peace seemed to have come down <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>upon him,
with silent expectancy in it, as if he stood at the meeting-place
of the two worlds and took both into his field of vision.&nbsp;
The depressions of former years were gone, and but that our
&lsquo;eyes were holden&rsquo; by a merciful blindness, we might
have known that the Master&rsquo;s coming was at hand.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The population in South Kensington by this time had enormously
increased.&nbsp; The relics of rural life repeatedly noticed in
this volume disappeared, and the crowded neighbourhood called for
spiritual provision.&nbsp; At a social meeting in January, 1879,
a resolution was passed expressive of gratitude for the goodness
of God, and of a conviction that the time had come for making a
vigorous effort to extend to one of the newly-peopled districts
in the neighbourhood some of the privileges which the Church had
so long enjoyed; and a year afterwards, at a similar meeting, joy
was expressed that a good site had been found in West Kensington,
together with a determination to erect on it a chapel worthy of
the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>It is sad to record what follows.&nbsp; Dr. Raleigh removed to
Kensington at the close of the year 1875, early in 1880 he was
laid aside.&nbsp; On the 10th of March he sent to his
&ldquo;Flock and Friends&rdquo; this touching letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I must try to write a line to tell you what
a great grief it is to me that I am still prevented from meeting
you &lsquo;face to face.&rsquo;&nbsp; Pain and weariness have
been my portion during these last weeks.&nbsp; But God has upheld
me by His great goodness, and enabled me to cast all my care upon
Him, and to commit all my ways to Him.&nbsp; Indeed, I may say I
have but one serious care, the care that arises in my heart when
I think of you and of your interests in the Gospel, which I can
at present do little or nothing to promote.&nbsp; I know you are
<a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>being
well instructed by other servants of the Master, and that the
Chief Shepherd Himself never ceases to have you in His
care.&nbsp; Nor can I doubt that this unexpected and undesired
illness of your pastor is among the &lsquo;all things&rsquo;
which may work together for your good.&nbsp; With prayer and
patience on your part and on mine it will certainly be so, and
our God will supply all our need according to His glorious riches
by Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am assured by the deacons, both for themselves and
for you, that I may go on in the use of the best means for
recovery with a quiet mind, and in the confidence that you will
willingly and prayerfully wait for my restoration to strength,
and for what&mdash;if God graciously gives it&mdash;will
certainly be to me, even more than to you, a happy return to my
work.&nbsp; Of course all waiting of this kind must have
reasonable limits; but I think you may be assured that I am not
likely to forget them.&nbsp; I thank God that I have so much
reason to wish, I hope before very long, to be able to put my
hand again to a work which, in some ways at least, has prospered
so well.&nbsp; That this our mutual desire may be accomplished, I
cast myself with confidence on your sympathy; and still more
earnestly I make appeal to you for your prayers, that I may be
kept in unfailing trust, and that I may be restored to you the
sooner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for you, dear brethren, with all my heart I commend
you to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build
you up and to give you an inheritance among all them that are
sanctified.&nbsp; The Shepherd of Israel have you in His
care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with
you.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Raleigh&rsquo;s last hours are thus described by his wife
in her beautiful memoirs of him:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Throughout the night of 17th April he was
very restless, and said, &lsquo;I have not been able for two days
to think any religious thoughts, but I know that I am
His.&rsquo;&nbsp; When the morning came (Sunday) his countenance
wore the changed look we learn to know too well, and he spoke of
his departure as at hand, as indeed he felt it was.&nbsp; His
wife, wishing as usual to send a message to be read to his
people, asked him what it should be.&nbsp; He hesitated, saying,
&lsquo;I do not want to alarm them, and it looks as if I were of
such importance if <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>I send a message.&rsquo;&nbsp; He consented, however,
and dictated a few words.&nbsp; Many things were talked over, and
last words spoken during the day.&nbsp; The wrench of parting was
still hard to him, and the spring sunshine seemed too glad for
dying eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;Everything is as bright as if I were
well,&rsquo; he said; but looked an earnest assent when reminded
that in this lay the hidden promise of a better
spring-time.&nbsp; Some food being brought him, of which he tried
in vain to partake, he put it gently aside, saying, &lsquo;The
Bread of Life is near.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again: &lsquo;I should like
to go to-day; it is <i>my</i> day.&rsquo;&nbsp; His whispered
words to his children; his expressed thoughts and cares about
their future; his last looks of love and welcome, are laid up in
the sacred silence of the heart &lsquo;till the day
dawn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the evening drew on he became restless with the
restlessness so common at the approach of death.&nbsp; The weary
spirit, finding home no longer in the dissolving body, was
struggling to break the chain and enter into the life of
liberty.&nbsp; The eyes, always so responsive to the light, grew
dim, unconsciousness fell gradually over him, and before we knew
it he was away beyond reach of loving word or touch of ours; but
we believe he was not beyond the reach of higher
ministries.&nbsp; As the long night passed, and the slow dawn
found him still waiting at the gate, perhaps there came to his
spirit the first whispers of heavenly fellowship.&nbsp; Perhaps
&lsquo;Jesus Himself drew near and went with him.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Shortly after noon on Monday, 19th of April, 1880, he entered
calmly into rest.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was the first time that Death had laid his hand on any of
the Kensington pastors until after their removal from the
neighbourhood, and the new visitation was keenly felt.&nbsp; This
was testified in many ways, especially by the public funeral on
the 24th of April, 1880.&nbsp; A service was held in the chapel,
attended by a large concourse of ministerial and other
friends.&nbsp; The Rev. J. G. Rogers delivered a funeral oration,
dwelling upon the character of his deceased friend and
fellow-student.&nbsp; The procession afterwards wound its solemn
way to Abney Park.&nbsp; <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>&ldquo;When the
<i>cort&eacute;ge</i> approached, all were hushed to silence and
many an eye was wet with tears.&nbsp; The line of spectators
stretched from the Church Street entrance gates, past the open
grave, and overlapping but not surrounding it.&nbsp; Hardly a
sound was heard but the grating of the footsteps of the bearers
of the coffin and the procession on the gravel.&nbsp; Preceded by
the Rev. Henry Allon, D.D.; the Rev. J. Guinness Rogers; the Rev.
Mr. Glyn, Vicar of Kensington; and the Rev. W. M. Statham; and
followed by all Dr. Raleigh&rsquo;s children (except the eldest)
and other members of his family, and various friends and
delegates, the coffin, literally covered and re-covered with
flowers, was borne to the tomb.&nbsp; Then Dr. Allon conducted
the solemn service, in which the Rev. Mr. Glyn took part; after
which all who desired had an opportunity of taking a last look at
the grave, and many deposited there their offering of
flowers&mdash;their symbol of affection.&nbsp; Presently the
earth would be covered in, and all would be over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Funeral sermons were preached at Kensington Chapel on the
following Sunday by Dr. Allon and Mr. Rogers.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>To resume the mode of expression adopted in the earlier
portion of this volume, and only dropped in describing the
pastorate preceding that of Dr. Raleigh, I shall ever deeply
regret that, through absence from England, I was unable to take
any part in these solemnities.&nbsp; I was not aware of his
serious illness until the fact was communicated to me in Rome,
and scarcely <a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>had I received the sad intimation when the news of his
death arrived; and I was shocked to find that the dear Kensington
Church was again destitute, and that I had lost an honoured
friend.</p>

117</span>VII.&nbsp; THE SEVENTH PASTORATE.<br />
<i>THE REV. COLMER B. SYMES</i>.<br />
1880&mdash;</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> interregnum between Mr.
Clayton&rsquo;s removal and Dr. Leifchild&rsquo;s arrival
extended beyond two years and a half; but breaks in the after
history of the pastorate were remarkably short.&nbsp; Two months
only elapsed between Dr. Leifchild&rsquo;s retirement and the
commencement of Dr. Vaughan&rsquo;s labours.&nbsp; Dr. Vaughan
terminated his Kensington ministry in May, I accepted a call from
the Church in July; Dr. Raleigh&rsquo;s removal to Kensington was
about six months after his predecessor left; Dr. Raleigh died in
April, his successor was elected at the beginning of
November.&nbsp; The comparative brevity of these intervals, when
placed beside the history of many other Congregational Churches,
is remarkable, and inspires special thankfulness in a community
in this respect so highly favoured.&nbsp; At no period has there
been divided feeling amongst the members with regard to a new
minister.&nbsp; Rival candidates are unknown at Kensington, and
proceedings <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>relative to filling up vacancies have ever been
conducted in a spirit of entire harmony and love.</p>
<p>The Rev. Colmer B. Symes, of Exeter, having been strongly
recommended as likely to meet the needs of the Church, a meeting
was held on the 4th of November, 1880, to decide whether he
should be invited as Dr. Raleigh&rsquo;s successor.&nbsp; The
course adopted was the same as on the last occasion.&nbsp; The
Church passed a resolution, unanimous and cordial, that Mr. Symes
should be requested to accept the pastorship; then the deacons
were to convey that resolution, and to urge &ldquo;the acceptance
of the important office to which he had been
elected.&rdquo;&nbsp; The deacons visited Mr. Symes at Exeter,
and discharged fully the duty intrusted to them by their fellow
members.</p>
<p>The gratifying result appears in Mr. Symes&rsquo; reply on the
13th of November, 1880:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Christian
Brethren</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In replying to your kind invitation to assume the
pastorate among you, I have at the outset to thank you for the
undeserved honour which you have done me, and to recognise the
increased value of your invitation through the thoughtful
delicacy of your deacons, who came to Exeter that they might
present it personally to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is needless to dwell on the anxiety which your
action has caused, or upon the painful sense of responsibility
under which I have approached the decision of my own
course.&nbsp; You will fully understand that the step which you
have asked me to take involves the very gravest results, both to
you and to my beloved congregation at Exeter.&nbsp; Such a step
is a crisis in a man&rsquo;s life; and the consideration of it
penetrates one through and through with the conviction, &lsquo;It
is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.&rsquo;&nbsp; To
<a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>say then
that I have thought much and prayed earnestly over this question,
is only to assure you that I have done what, under such
circumstances, any Christian man of honest purpose <i>must</i>
do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the result of such thought and prayer, of a simple
surrender of my movements to the guidance of a higher wisdom than
my own, and of earnest effort to interpret that guidance, I now
accept your invitation to the pastorate as cordially as you have
given it; and while utterly unconscious of any fitness, mentally
or spiritually, to achieve a true success, I am confident that
God has called me to work at Kensington, and for that work
&lsquo;my sufficiency is of God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When your deacons showed me that, although I had felt
obliged to present passive resistance to your previous kind
advances, God had led you to an unanimous decision, I felt that
my duty was written in letters of light, and I could have given
an immediate reply.&nbsp; That reply has been delayed a week,
partly to correct or confirm what might have been a hasty
judgment, and partly that I might rise to the level of that
Apostolic charge, in which we pastors are urged to take the
oversight of the flock of God, &lsquo;not <i>by constraint</i>,
but willingly.&rsquo;&nbsp; A week ago I was conscious of Divine
coercion, the compulsion of duty.&nbsp; I did not like to pass
before you as a captive dragged in triumph behind the chariot of
a Divine regal purpose.&nbsp; I would rather come before you as
the willing herald to announce the presence of the King amongst
you, and to describe to you the joys of His royal rule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not, I am sure, be pained at this allusion to
past unwillingness.&nbsp; I should be unworthy of the love I hope
to win from you, if I could callously cut those living nerves of
loving friendship which, during the past four years, have
thrilled again and again at the touch of as tender a sympathy as
a pastor could wish to enjoy.&nbsp; I am asked to leave an
earnest, warm-hearted, united, and useful congregation, who have
laid me under the deepest indebtedness by their sensitiveness to
my ministry, by their love in my deep sorrow, by their unbroken
harmony, and by their zealous fellowship with me in all service
to Christ.&nbsp; I have never received one harsh word or one cold
look from them; and I should be less than human if I could part
with such people painlessly.&nbsp; Still I do feel very
distinctly that the unanimity of your judgment in offering to me
the splendid opportunities of service to Christ, which your
neighbourhood presents&mdash;confirmed as that judgment has been
by impartial <a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>advisers on all hands, to whom both you and I have
appealed for counsel&mdash;may be accepted as the tones of a
Divine call; and with <i>gladness</i> and <i>thankfulness</i> for
the honour of service to Christ among you, I accept the
pastorate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When first asked to preach to you in my holidays, I
quite understood the full significance of the visit; but as your
request had come to me when at leisure, and had come so unsought,
I felt that I dared not refuse to take the step which God seemed
to indicate; and therefore I preached to you in August.&nbsp;
Since then I have felt that I must maintain a very passive
attitude; and, at every subsequent stage, I have earnestly prayed
that God would allow your action to express His will to me.&nbsp;
I pledged myself to Him that I would say or do nothing myself,
and that I would accept your perseverance or your discontinuance
as the revelation of His will for my life.&nbsp; I am therefore
bound in simple truthfulness to act on your decision, and to feel
at rest on the score of Divine guidance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, however, a great comfort to me that the judgment
of all whom I have consulted outside my own congregation concur
in your decision and in the response which I have given.&nbsp;
May God so generously help me in my ministry, and in His great
condescension use me to impart unto you such spiritual gifts that
you and I shall rejoice together in the union which we now form;
and to Him from whom alone all the grace must come will we give
all the praise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to the future, the less I say the better.&nbsp; It
is, perhaps, wise that a man should <i>do</i> as much as he can,
and <i>talk</i> as little as may be of what he intends to
do.&nbsp; I might paint you a picture of what I mean my ministry
to be; but you would see at once that the picture was painted
with the trembling brush of a human purpose, and that it was
scarcely worth your while to examine it.&nbsp; I would rather
leave the light of God to photograph the actual ministry as it
shall be worked out from day to day; and may the picture satisfy
your spiritual perceptions, and, above all, be acceptable to
God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While, however, it is wise to be silent about all my
expectations of service among you, I will tell you what is clear
to me, and is invested with no uncertainty.&nbsp; I am coming to
preach to you the love and the power of a living Christ, who has
expiated the guilt of our sins by His wondrous death; who
mediates for us to-day before the throne; who now ministers to us
through the Spirit with wisest <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>teachings and gentlest comforts and
holiest inspirations; that living Christ who is the Alpha and the
Omega of all that is noblest and truest in human life, and who
will help us to fulfil our purer purposes until He presents us
guiltless and without fault before His Father&rsquo;s
throne.&nbsp; This will be the burden of my ministry; and may
that Spirit of God, without whom the most truthful, earnest, and
sincere ministry will be powerless, enable you and dispose you to
receive this Gospel from me as the Word of God.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;I am, dear Christian
brethren,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Yours in Christ Jesus,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Colmer</span> B. <span
class="smcap">Symes</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A recognition service was held at Kensington Chapel, when I
was again invited to preside; and amongst the ministers and
friends present were the Rev. Dr. Allon, the Rev. Dr. Hannay, the
Revs. J. C. Harrison, Newman Hall, C. E. B. Reed, J. H. Russell,
A. Mearns, W. Roberts, Messrs. H. Wright, W. Holborn, and R.
Freeman.</p>
<p>It had rarely, if ever, fallen to the lot of a minister after
his retirement from a Church to preside on two occasions at the
introduction of a new minister.&nbsp; I little thought that I
should have to discharge such duty as devolved on me that
evening.&nbsp; It seemed, I said, but the other day since they
assembled to welcome Dr. Raleigh, and though so long a term of
service as had been allowed to his predecessor could not have
been expected, it might have been hoped that the former would
have survived the latter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I feel how great your loss
has been, and deeply do I sympathize with you in this respect;
and I am anxious to say so now, because on account of my being in
Italy at the time <a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>of Dr. Raleigh&rsquo;s interment, I had not an
opportunity of then tendering in public my sincere
condolence.&nbsp; But whilst I mourn over what you have lost, I
would rejoice on account of what you gain this evening.&nbsp; I
have not yet had the pleasure of an intimate acquaintance with
Mr. Symes.&nbsp; I believe I never met him but once, and then he
made, during a short space, a much more favourable impression on
my mind than I have sometimes received from far longer interviews
with other brethren.&nbsp; My heart is filled with gratitude to
God for having sent you such a man in the room of him who could
not continue by reason of death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this occasion, much additional interest was imparted by the
presence of an Exeter deacon, who came to testify the love of the
Exeter Church for the pastor who had left them.&nbsp;
&ldquo;God,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;has blessed him very
much.&nbsp; We have about three hundred and fifty members, and
during Mr. Symes&rsquo; short pastorate of five or six years,
about two hundred have joined our Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The
young especially have rallied round him; and we could point to
many institutions showing where his usefulness has been so
marked.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;His removal has been a county loss,
and will be felt at chapel openings and harvest homes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new pastor followed, saying, amongst other
things:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I come to preach Christ to this
congregation&mdash;the living Christ, who by His sacrifice has
expiated our guilt upon the cross, and is able to free us from
the guilt and from the power of sin; the Christ <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>who is
living and acting to-day as our Mediator, and is securing for us
all spiritual blessings; the Christ who is the Lord of our life,
whose will and leadership we, His people, are bound by the most
solemn commands to obey; the Christ whose friendship is the joy
of life, whose teaching settles all the creeds, and who in some
mysterious sense includes within Himself all His believing people
in His renewed life, and vitalizes all as the vine can vitalize
its branches.&nbsp; In preaching such a Christ as this, there
need be no narrowness in the ministry: it will be my own fault if
there is.&nbsp; Christ touches human life at all points.&nbsp; To
preach Christ fully is to raise the most profound intellectual
problems, for Christ has localized the thoughts of men in every
race.&nbsp; To preach Him fully, is to assert His claims, and to
press those claims upon every sphere of human life, the personal
and the political, the domestic and the congregational, the
mercantile and the mirthful, the social and the sacred.&nbsp;
Christ touches human life on all sides, and it is mine to preach
Christ fully, and not to furnish a narrow ministry.&nbsp; I come
then, dear brethren, to preach to you the Christ whose love is
more than life to me; who has soothed me when, with broken heart,
I have felt life unbearable; who has sustained me in ministerial
work and trial extending over many years; who has stood by me in
every effort which I have made, and who has most generously
succoured me in my weakness and raised me when I have
fallen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Confessions of faith on such an occasion are not so common now
as once they were; but this admirable summary of truth was
volunteered and delivered in a spirit which left nothing more to
be desired; and what may not be hoped from a ministry commenced
with such evangelical views and such hallowed resolutions?</p>
<p>In the second year of Mr. Symes&rsquo; ministry the foundation
stone of the West Kensington Congregational Chapel was
laid.&nbsp; On the 2nd of November, 1882, a large number of
friends assembled to witness the ceremony performed by the
venerable and catholic-spirited Earl of Shaftesbury.&nbsp; <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>Mr. Wright
gave a statement of the circumstances which had led to the
gratifying event of the day.&nbsp; He said that,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In January, 1880, at a meeting held at the
house of Mr. Edward Spicer, and attended by the late Dr. Raleigh,
the deacons of the Church, and other ministers and laymen, it was
resolved that a site should be secured for the erection of a
Congregational Church, and a fund was started to which Dr.
Raleigh subscribed &pound;50, and six other gentlemen present
&pound;250 each; &pound;250 was also promised by an absent
deacon.&nbsp; After protracted inquiries and negotiations the
present site was purchased.&nbsp; The London Congregational Union
had voted &pound;1,600 towards its cost, and the London Chapel
Building Society &pound;1,000 towards the erection of the
church.&nbsp; The progress of the work was arrested by the
lamented decease of Dr. Raleigh, but when the Rev. C. B. Symes
entered on his ministry he gave new impetus to it, and liberally
subscribed &pound;250 toward the fund.&nbsp; The building to be
erected was from the design of Mr. J. Cubitt, and the work had
received the approval of many friends not connected with the
district, two of whom had subscribed &pound;500 each, and another
noble citizen of London &pound;200.&nbsp; The gifts by
individuals ranged from &pound;1,000 to five farthings from a
little boy not quite eight years old!&nbsp; In that work they
were trying to solve the problem how to penetrate the population
with the spirit of true religion, and the building would be
dedicated to the service and worship of Almighty God and His
blessed Son, with the prayer that the Lord Jesus Christ might be
the master of the house, the King of the people, and the Shepherd
of the flock which might be gathered there.&nbsp; It would be a
Free Church, independent of all external support and control; the
worship would be free and spiritual, and the ordinances would be
sustained by the free-will offerings of God&rsquo;s people.&nbsp;
It was not undertaken in hostility to any existing church in the
neighbourhood, and there was nothing to hinder its promoters
saying, &lsquo;Grace be with all them that love the Lord Jesus
Christ in sincerity.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the evening of the same day a meeting was held at the
Vestry Hall, Kensington, when Mr. John Kemp Welch presided, and
Messrs. James Spicer, J.P., H. <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>Wright, J.P., Dr. Hannay, the Rev.
C. B. Symes, Mr. J. H. Fordham, Mr. Robert Freeman, Mr. William
Holborn, and Messrs. H. and E. Spicer supported the
chairman.&nbsp; The sum of &pound;14,190 was required, and before
the close of the meeting no less than &pound;12,084 was
subscribed or promised.&nbsp; The following appeared in the
report:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dr. Stoughton said he would like to tell
those present a little of what had been done in days gone by,
when a considerable movement began in 1849, resulting in the
erection of five new chapels in the space of ten years.&nbsp;
They were not all connected with Allen Street Church, but they
all sprang out of the operation of the voluntary principle, and
the Kensington people had something to do with all of them.&nbsp;
It began with the erection of Horbury Chapel, Notting Hill; and
was followed by Kensington Chapel; Oakland&rsquo;s Chapel,
Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush; Edith Grove, Brompton; and Cravenhill
chapels.&nbsp; Those chapels could not have cost less than thirty
or forty thousand pounds, and the liabilities were all undertaken
during those ten years.&nbsp; If they added another ten years for
paying off those debts, they would see that &pound;30,000 or
&pound;40,000 was expended in chapel building work during that
period.&nbsp; The fathers were not quite asleep, and the sons had
very grateful recollections of what they did in days that were
past.&nbsp; He referred to it as an example for them to emulate,
and to go on during the next ten or twenty years as their
predecessors did.&nbsp; If they laid out &pound;30,000 or
&pound;40,000 outside their church, it would be a noble
thing.&nbsp; The debt on Allen Street was paid off five years
after it was opened, and he was then very anxious to see a new
chapel spring up in South or West Kensington, where there was
much vacant land which he knew would in time be covered with
houses.&nbsp; A variety of circumstances, however, prevented his
realising that desire; but now that streets and squares had been
built, and the name changed from North End to West Kensington,
they had done nobly and wisely in setting to work to build the
contemplated edifice.&nbsp; He heartily congratulated them upon
their present position, and on the relationship existing between
pastor and people.&nbsp; Mr. Symes was doing work which had not
previously been done, and was laying hold of young people brought
into the neighbourhood; <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>the speaker looked most hopefully
upon these circumstances and trusted that the Church in Allen
Street would go on as prosperously as ever.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here I must bring my narrative to a close.&nbsp; The ninety
years&rsquo; history now recorded exhibits the continuity, the
development, the increase, the augmented resources, and the
advancing power of the Kensington Congregational Church.&nbsp;
Religious progress has followed, though not with equal steps,
progress in other respects, visible throughout the Court suburb,
and its vicinity.&nbsp; The <i>duplication</i> of the
ecclesiastical body, if so the movement at Horbury about thirty
years ago may be termed, is now, thanks to our Heavenly Father,
being repeated; but gratitude to Him for this renewed inspiration
of zeal is mingled with regret that the effort has been so long
delayed.&nbsp; May it now be carried forward with ardour, in the
spirit of faith, love, and prayer, and may other similar
operations follow in years to come,&mdash;the activity and
self-sacrifice of Kensington Christians keeping pace with the
wants of the neighbourhood!&nbsp; The results at Notting Hill
ought to be combined with those at Kensington, in order to
estimate the value of what was done more than thirty years
ago.&nbsp; The congregations, the members, the contributions
since, should be reckoned together in a sum total; and a
proportionate increase continued through coming days will secure
an aggregate most blessed to contemplate, illustrating the true
law of progress in Congregationalism.&nbsp; It will be
God&rsquo;s building, God&rsquo;s <a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>husbandry, a working together with
Him and under Him: ministers and people being one with the
Church&rsquo;s Lord.&nbsp; What purity of communion, what
brotherly love, what self-sacrificing zeal, what achievements of
benevolence, what noble family lives, what numerous conversions
to Christ may be anticipated in consequence of aims and
endeavours such as are now suggested!&nbsp; If the Church be a
Divine garden, growth, fruitfulness, beauty ought to be
expected.&nbsp; Rich abundance will crown a field which the Lord
hath blessed.&nbsp; The most prosperous Churches in Christendom
only exhibit what may be called, in the highest sense, a
<i>natural</i> result of His superintendence and blessing.&nbsp;
What spiritual wonders may be looked for, what earnest, humble
work should be attempted, what encouragement under heavy
responsibility, what comfort amidst trials and disappointments
will assuredly come in the garden of our toils, our hopes, our
joys,&mdash;&ldquo;supposing Him to be the Gardener!&rdquo; <a

states:&mdash;&ldquo;It was not, however, until 1847 that any

of October in that year, five friends connected with the Church
at Hornton Street (<i>i.e.</i> the Rev. John Stoughton, the
pastor, Messrs. Walker, Robert Watson, and Robinson, three of the
deacons, and Mr. Shepheard, also a member of the Church) met, and
forming themselves into a committee, resolved, &lsquo;That it was
desirable an Independent Chapel should be built in the
neighbourhood of Notting Hill.&rsquo;&nbsp; Two of their number
were deputed to look out for ground; and, after much difficulty
and delay in selecting a suitable site for the building, the
present very eligible piece of ground was secured at a price of
&pound;630, on lease for eighty-eight years, at a peppercorn
rent.&rdquo;&nbsp; The freehold was subsequently purchased.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The name of Horbury Chapel was given to the building as a
mark of respect to the treasurer, Mr. Walker, who, by his
liberality and exertions, so largely contributed to the success
of the undertaking, the village of Horbury, in Yorkshire, being
his birthplace.&rdquo;&nbsp; The small committee formed in
October, 1847, was soon enlarged by the addition of several other
members of the Kensington Church.&nbsp; The Rev. W. Roberts was
publicly recognised on the 17th of April, 1850, when the Rev. Dr.
Morison, the Revs. J. Stratton, J. H. Godwin, and J. Stoughton
took part in the service.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
